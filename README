SimpleLog was originally created in 2006 circa Rails 1.0 or 1.1, I'm not sure. 
The last release of the original SimpleLog was version 2.0.2 on Feb. 15 2007
(for Rails 1.x). Since then it is no longer maintained by the original author, Garrett Murphy.
There is still plenty of information about original SimpleLog at http://simplelog.net/ .

SimpleLog-X is my version of SimpleLog that runs on Rails 2.x.
I'm making it available publicly because other people who know I have it have asked for it,
and I think it serves a useful purpose for people who want to run their blog on Rails
but don't want to roll it from scratch (or like myself when I started, wouldn't know how to).

In addition to keeping it up to date I've made other changes...

Major changes from original SimpleLog:
 * Works on Rails 2.x
 * Added attachments to posts
 * changed post/page editor to WYSIWYG, using WYM editor
 * gradually slimming down the code and transitioning to modern Ruby/Rails methods

Things that I've removed:
 * themes, the themes plugin used was not updated to Rails 2 and I saw no value in it anyway
 * search (temporarily... TODO restore this...)

Major Todos:
 * TODO: Get all of my personal junk out of the public folder!!! (move files to public/system?)
 * refactor the controllers to have a single controller instead of one for display and one for admin
 * convert to RESTful routing (this depends on the above)
 * multiple attachments, non image attachments
 * possibly support OpenID etc. for comments
 * apply tags and comments to the CMS section
 * whatever else happens in the blogoworld

TODO: fix gravatar size (64x64?)
TODO: unit tests in at least post_controller_test need to check the actual values that are assigned
TODO: make attachment images show up in regular view as well as detailed view
TODO: merge item and item_detailed and get rid of as many helpers as possible
