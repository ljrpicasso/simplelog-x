This is my own version of SimpleLog that runs on Rails 2.

The original SimpleLog ( http://simplelog.net/ ) does not work on Rails 2 and it seems that
it is no longer maintained.

In addition to Rails 2, I also added WYM Editor to the posts admin page, attachments using
paperclip, and some other things. On the other hand, I also removed some functionality... 
more information TODO.
