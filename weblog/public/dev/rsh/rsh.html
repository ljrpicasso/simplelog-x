<P>October 22, 1999:</P>
<P>
I'm afraid to say that it looks like this project is dead. I haven't done
any work on it in quite some time. Anyone who wants to use my code and
continue the work I'm happy to have you do that.  Gabe Bauman has done
some good work at 
<a target="_top" href="http://www.mhk.vancouverpages.nu/">his MHK page</a>
so check that out too.</P>

<P>I'm still working on RSH (really slowly).  Right now I've managed to get a valid
WAVE header along with the sound output, but it sounds really distorted.  I'm now 
very confused about what type of ADPCM they are really using.  From the MHK files it
looks like MS ADPCM, but that doesn't work in the WAVEs.  I'm working with the 
creator of SoundHack, Tom Erbe, to figure it out, since his program plays the sounds
really well.  If you want a version, email me.

<P>The current version of RivenSoundHack is Alpha 2

<H3>Release Notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>  This version is actually useful!  It allows you to choose a
resource and save it.  Unfortunately, it only works in Windows under
Visual J++ :-( 
</LI>
<LI> RivenSoundHack is written in Java!  Yeah!  Why, you ask?  Well,
mainly because I want to learn Java (and OOD) but also because that way
those pesky PC users will be able to use RSH as well.  
</LI>
<LI> RivenSoundHack is public domain.  Source code is included in the
download package.  Let me know if you get the urge to tinker and want to
have stuff included with the next release (eg. a better UI, allow users to
modify the sounds in the MHKs..).

<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>
This program relates to the awesome game <A HREF="http://www.riven.com/">Riven</A> (The Sequel to 
<A HREF="http://www.myst.com/">MYST</A>) by
<A HREF="http://www.cyan.com/">Cyan</A>.
</P>

<P>
 The purpose of this program is to listen to the great music in Riven at any time on the
 computer.  The music is stored in the .MHK files found in the Data directory on the
 hard drive where Riven has been installed.  Specifically, it is stored in the files
 named X_sounds.MHK (where X is some letter).
</P>
 
<P>
 In addition, the music is also compressed with ADPCM 4-1 pulse-code
 modulation compression which is a pain in the butt (although it's a sweet
 compression system) and means I have to create a header and tack it on
the the front of the files.  The music is compressed in the WAVE
(Microsoft) ADPCM format. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mac, "SoundHack" by Tom Erbe is capable of playing ADPCM
compressed files without a header, which is the only way to do it right
now.. On the PC there doesn't sem to be any program 
capable of fudging the headers, but as soon as I get the headers
working any Windows program will be able to play it.

<H3>DOWNLOAD RivenSoundHack Alpha 2 (developer)</H3>

<P> The 2nd developer release of RSH is now available.
<A HREF="rsh.zip">Download</A> it.  Unfortunately this release uses
the Windows WFC windowing classes and is thus dependent on Windows.
It runs under Visual J++, other configurations are unknown.
</P>
  
<P> The first developer release of RSH is available.  <A
HREF="alpha_1_dev_rel.zip">Download</A> it.
