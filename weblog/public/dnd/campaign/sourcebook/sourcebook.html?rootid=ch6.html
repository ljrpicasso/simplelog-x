<h3 class="title"><a id="id2508294"></a>History of Edion</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The recorded history of Edion begins ten thousand years in the past in Elara
with the stories of Bish, a semi-mythical figure who founded the first monasteries in the countryside. Bish is also said to have introduced writing to the elves. Bish himself, is said to have been an elf who lived a long time, perhaps a thousand years. Eventually he travelled into Ceylar, which even in those days was a remote and xenophobic country. The circumstances of his death are unknown, and some speculate that he lives on to this day.
</p>
<p>It was many more thousands of years more before the elves of Eastern Edion joined 
together into a single nation. 
This occurred seven millenia ago, in the year counted today as 
<span class="emphasis"><em>-2242 BF</em></span>.
In that year, the individual nations of elves joined together and appointed a Council of Elders to govern their joint affairs. The individual nations became provinces of Elara.
</p>
<p>Around this time, two thousand years before the founding of Galadhur, the people of that nation were still in a relatively primitive state. There were three cultures living around the edges of the Filgreen Coast of Western Edion: the Wolds, Firs, and Läns. These people were engaged in constant struggles of control over the fertile lands around the bay.
</p>
<p>In part the unification of the elves was a response to attacks on their 
territories by the Läns, first, and then the Wolds. About one elf's lifetime 
after the nation was founded 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>-1767 BF</em></span>),
 the people of the Filgreen Coast, united under the Wolds, led an ill-fated invasion of 
Elara. They were easily repelled but the elves abhorred the incessent violence and 
decided to take matters into their own hands. They slaughtered half of the population 
of the Coast and mixed their blood with the Coasters in equal numbers. It was not 
long before virtually every human living on Edion had half-elven parentage. After a 
few hundred years (in the 
<span class="emphasis"><em>-1400s BF</em></span>) the elves withdrew.
</p>
<p>The elven blood had a fairly dramatic effect on the proto-Galadhrians. Despite being a subjugated people, they quickly developed a mastery of the arcane arts that is a benefit of elven ancestry. They also were pacified and ceased warring amongst themselves and on their neighbours.
</p>
<p>Instead the people of the Filgreen Coast turned to exploration as an outlet for their great creativity and outgoing natures. They developed impressive sailing vessels and soon had founded a strong economy on the basis of trade with the races and cultures they met in the surrounding sea region. After some time they grew to provide the elves (who had no love for the sea) with many products and services not otherwise available to them. Over time, a great friendship grew up between the two peoples.
</p>
<p>At last, a new nation of Galadhur was founded, starting a new era 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>0 FC</em></span>).
 The Founder's Count of years begins in this year, when the foundation stone of Galadhur-sild (the great castle of Freeport) was laid. The Galadhrians had spread the science of writing, originally learned from the elves, throughout the Alimides and had considerable influence on their neighbouring nations. It is for this reason that their years are used as the standard throughout Edion and the Alimides.
</p>
<p>The next thousand years were a time of peach and prosperity for the two Edionic nations. Traffic between them grew strong both along the coastal waters and roads that passed south of and even through the Tikmurn mountain range. With the assistance of the dwarves, a tunnel was built through the mountains as a shortcut for travellers.
</p>
<p>The opening of trade with Galadhur also greatly facilitated the trade of gems 
with the dwarves who lived to the north of Galadhur in the Doromore mountains. 
Although the Tikmurn dwarves were fine miners, their time ended not long after when they
were driven out by orcs 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>822 FC</em></span>).
 The Doromore dwarves remain steadfast suppliers of gems to the magicians of Elara.
</p>
<p>The end of this first Galadhrian millenia saw the descent of orcs from the center of the continent down the Tikmurn mountains to the sea, threatening both Elara and Galadhur. The orcs were easily held off by the elven mages and the dense Elaran jungle, but the Galadhrians fared less well in the western foothills.
</p>
<p>After a time 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>1077 FC</em></span>)
 a Galadhrian general arose to drive back the orcs. His name was Starc, and a city was named in his honour. Sad to say, it did not outlast his own life, as he died fighting a redoubled strength of orcs who overran the city only eighty years later. Since then, the humans have withdrawn and orcs have held a narrow stretch of land between Galadhur and Elara. Most traffic now passes by sea, and so elves rarely visit Galadhur.
</p>
<p>There was a brief war between orcs and Galadhrians around the time of Queen Stefine
(<span class="emphasis"><em>1833 FC</em></span>).
 A group of orcs united under a powerful chieftain gained the upper hand in a series of skirmishes and over the next fifty years, the eastern frontier of Galadhur was pushed back to the banks of the river Ingrid. It seemed as though a new kind of orc had appeared from the mountains to lead their lesser cousins who lived in the lowlands. A bold attack by the Galadhrians crushed the chieftains, and the two sides settled into an uneasy truce. Castles and garrisons are still manned along the river by Galadhur against the occasional raid or assault.
</p>
<p>Through the ebb and flow of time, the borders have changed little since then. For 
thousands of years Edion and the Alimides have been at peace, punctuated only by a 
brief assault on Elara by the Cardanites 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>3362 FC</em></span>)
that was swiftly broken.
</p>
<p>More recently, in the last five hundred years 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>4000s FC</em></span>)
 a new power has slowly arisen in the far East and begun to influence events in Edion. This is the empire of Tria, a vast power in a distant land that has begun to show an interest recently in Elaran affairs.
