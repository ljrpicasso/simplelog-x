<p><span class="emphasis"><em>The sun is setting on Arcos. A flock of starlings flits across the sky, as the orange rays of the sun cast a long shadow from the Tree of Life across the golden quarter of the city into the deep forest beyond. Glints of sunlight reflect lazily off the pinnacles and spinarets of the city. Out across the bay, sailboats gently glide through the harbour in the gentle dusk breeze. In the quiet of the air, the vague sound of merry making wafts up from below as the business of the day wraps itself to a close and evening begins.</em></span>
</p>
<p>Edion is both a continent and a fantasy campaign world. With the city of Arcos as its hub, the Elaran nation of elves spreads its influence across a vast array of nations and islands, neighbours and allies, and distant empires. The land of elves is a land of plenty, a land of prosperity and a tropical paradise for its inhabitants. For others, it is a source of magic, of civilization and learning, of strength for the entire region.
</p>
<p>Elara is just one part of Edion. The nation of adventurous humans lies to the West, and enterprising dwarves live in the central mountain ranges. A vast archipelago of small island spreads southwards from the main continent, giving rise to an entire seafaring region. The whole of the Alimides, as this area of the world is known, is peaceful and prosperous, and has been for as long as history records ... many thousands of years.
</p>
<p>Yet there are some clouds on the horizon. A distant, expansionist empire threatens to the East. Unknown monsters have been found lurking in the remote mountains of Edion. And archeologists are uncovering the remnants of an ancient civilization in islands far to the south.
</p>
<p>Still, times are good. Opportunities are ripe in the jungles and lush tropical forests of the Alimides, and adventure awaits those who seek it out...

<h4 class="title"><a id="galad"></a>Humans of Galadhur</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Galadhrians are an ancient race of humans from the area around the Filgreen Coast. They have always been known for their unquenchable desire to explore and their epic adventurousness. To this they add their elven characteristic of practicality and patience. The Galadhrians are a powerhouse of adventurers and traders abroad, but inhumanly stable at home. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Galadhrians typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Their skin is tan, their hair is often curly though straight is known, and facial hair on men ranges from sparse to thick. Galadhrian dress is usually practical and durable, though any number of styles may be seen. Galadhrian humans usually mature at age 20, and often live in excess of 150 years. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> These world travelers mix readily with any race. They are generally very polite, but sometimes this formality is mistaken for coolness. Galadhrians are found in every civilized corner of the world, but it is rare for them to settle down permanently outside of the Alimides. They often serve as merchants, traders, magistrates, and diplomats. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Galadhrians are most frequently good in alignment, and tend towards law or neutrality. Even the heroic adventurers of old were respectful of their nation's institutions. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Galadhrian Lands:</strong></span> Galadhur is a tropical country with rich soil for agriculture. Most of the nation is covered by rural farms and villages. The people tend to be peaceful and prosperous due to the regularity of the seasons. Around the Green Bay and along the coast, fishing is common. Trade is also conducted with the dwarves in the North, who virtually depend on the Galadhrians, and with the rest of the world through Freeport. 
    </p>
<p>Foreigners are common in the major cities of Galadhur, but rare in the countryside. Dwarves are often seen in the north, and traveling along roads to Freeport. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Galadhrians speak Galadhrian, which is also used in trading centers throughout the Alimides. Galadhrian has a written form that has existed for thousands of years, and is loosely based on the elven script. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Thurden.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Female Names:</strong></span> Buffin, Fraua.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Adventuring is Galadhur's national heritage. Galadhrians consider it a prestigious occupation. Adventuring is moderated by the Adventurer's Guild, a powerful extra-national institution based in Freeport. Galadhrians adventure for glory above all, as well as wealth and power.

<p>This description applies to Trians as well as the humans from Thiria and Eila (subject nations of the Trian empire). 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description</strong></span>: Trians typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Their skin is olive in colour, and their hair is curly and ranges through blonde, brown and black. Facial hair on men can be sparse or thick. Trians have short life spans, achieving adulthood at about age 15 and rarely living even a single century. 
    </p>
<p>Trians have unusual eye coloring. The colour of the pupil changes with their emotional state (like a mood ring). The pupil colours are given in the figure below. In addition, the sclera of the eye (usually called the "white") is black offsetting the colour.

</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations</strong></span>: Trians are an overbearing people who desire control and power. They do not possess the sense of goodness that is common in Edion and to a lesser extent in the rest of the Alimides. Tria is an empire that rules over many neighbouring nations including Thiria and Eila. The Trian empire is intended for primarily for the benefit of Trians, and thus it is not popular in some quarters of the world. Individual Trian imperial agents are treated with suspicion in the Alimides. Other Trians are usually assessed on their individual merits, but the lingering suspicion remains. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion</strong></span>: Trians worship a pantheon of gods. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language</strong></span>: Trians speak Trian, the language spoken throughout the Trian empire.

<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Elara elves don't change very much over time. An Elaran elf might do the same job, make the same decisions, for fifty or a hundred years. Then, all of a sudden, a sudden fever will strike and he will change occupations, renounce his former style of thinking, or travel to a new land. This phenomenon can strike at any moment, without any warning, but it typically only happens once or twice in an elf's life, it ever. Otherwise, elves are inhumanly patient, willing to spend decades growing a specific plant to a specific shape, or to while away weeks discussing a certain point of philosophy. 
    </p>
<p>There is another form of the fever, called the rage, which has been known to infect entire populations of elves. The rage spreads a single individual's ideology to large groups, like an air-born infection. This occurs only rarely, perhaps once a century at most, but the results are generally famous (or infamous). 
    </p>
<p>Elves are curious and literate. They hold beauty and the arts dear. They are eager to learn, but like an armchair historian often prefer to let someone else to the work. Still, the other races prize their knowledge of theory and philosophy. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Elaran elves shorter than humans, ranging from 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet in height and weighing from 90 to 150 pounds. While graceful in appearance, they have longer arms and shorter legs than humans, a feature well suited to their tree-based lifestyle. Still, their limbs are lithe and slim. Elaran elves generally have tan skin, dark hair and deep green eyes. They have no facial or body hair. They prefer simple, comfortable clothes, and they enjoy simple yet elegant jewelry. An Elaran elf matures when he reaches the age of about 100, and they typically live to an age of about 550 years. 
    </p>
<p>Elaran elves sleep normally but eat less than half what a humans eats. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> Elaran humans have great respect for the Galadhrian humans with their adventurousness and stability. They tolerate Roarians, valuing their martial skill. Trians are abhorrent to Elaran elves, but no elf would ever treat any individual Trian with less than neutrality. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Elves love stability, variety and beauty. They tend towards neutrality when trying to make these sometimes conflicting views work together. Elves are virtually always good, desiring a world in which everyone is happy. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Elaran Elven Lands:</strong></span> Elaran elves tend to live in dense jungle, where they make their homes high in the mid-levels and the canopy of the trees. They use their mastery of plants and their endless patience to shape their homes, towns, and roads from the very flora that surrounds them. The lush jungle amply provides game for hunting as well as fruit, fungi and other food plants unknown outside their lands. Thus most elves have ample time to work crafts and arts which they trade with the outside world for metals and other raw materials. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span> Elaran elves mostly are atheist. Bishism is a monastic order based on the principles first expounded by the mythical monk Bish. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Elves speak a fluid language of subtle intonations and intricate grammar. While elven literature is rich and varied, it is the language's songs and poems that are most famous. While Elaran is a poetic language, Elarans usually use Galadhrian for practical texts and with foreigners. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Athravian, Delatar, Elashar, Eochar, Farmian, Helman, Lellendrile, NÃ¤mian, Renian, Sorfar, Teridel.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Female Names:</strong></span> Anyana, BindÃ«, EmenÃ«, FilmarÃ«, Lyana, RillenÃ«, Themerya, Wylana.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Elves take up adventuring because of wanderlust, often following a bout of the "fever." Some elves adventure on a voyage of discovery, seeing themselves as brave explorers. Often elves also enjoy impressing the other races with their wisdom and martial skill.

<h4 class="title"><a id="roarians"></a>Roarians</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Roarians are fierce predators and patient enemies. It is therefore fortunate for the other intelligent races that they also tend to be somewhat lazy. Roarians enjoy the hunt but also enjoy sitting and observing. They tend to be more aware of immediate rewards than long-term concerns. A certain fatalism may be part of the reason why Roarians usually claim to be unconcerned with the future. However, many Roarians seem to believe that their lives is in fact a struggle against a dark fate, an attitude that may reflect their animalistic origins. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Roarians resemble tigers that stand on two feet. While they are humanoid, they have claws, sharp teeth, and are thoroughly carnivorous. Their skin is covered in orange fur, striped with black, and as a result most Roarians wear clothing only on their lower body. They are tall, ranging from 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet tall on average, and well muscled. Their eyes are yellow and cat-like and their faces are generally whiskered. Roarians mature a little faster than humans, at age 12, and usually live no more than 70 years. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> Roarians get along well with elves, who share their love of the jungle. However unlike elves they are heavily involved in the present and don't appreciate the elven esteem for tradition. Their relations with the Galadhrian humans is more strained, since Roarians consider personal ties more important than official ones. The Roarian attitude towards Trians is strained, but the empire has so far proven uninterested or unable to dominate the Roarian jungles. Roarians treat them with initial suspicion but warm rapidly to Trians who are not zealous for the empire. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Roarians are usually chaotic, and they are often neutral. Traveling or adventuring Roarians tend towards good, however, since they quickly shake off their jungle kill-or-be-killed attitude. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Roarian Lands:</strong></span> Roarians tend to live deep in the jungle. There they form clans and villages in loose relationships. Roaria is a wild and mostly untamed wilderness, thick with the species upon which the tiger-people prey. 
    </p>
<p>Roarians in human lands are often mercenaries, hunters, bounty hunters, rogues and smugglers. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span> Roaria has two dominant religions. SÃ©dan is the dominant religion in the lowlands of Roaria, while mountain Roarians follow a mystical religion known as DanbulÃ©. The lowland religion SÃ©dan consists of a pantheon of gods representing natural features such as the sea, the forest, the sky, and so on. The most important deities are Rambula, goddess of the jungle predators and Vumjaa of the Rain. DanbulÃ© is a polytheistic religion with an uncounted number of deities. Virtually each practitioner is known to believe in a unique deity. The gods of DanbulÃ© however are merely manifestations of the spiritual power that surrounds all things. DanbulÃ©s practice animal sacrifice and enter trances influenced by powerful herbal mixtures where they believe they can speak to the gods and channel their powers. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Roarians speak Roarian, which uses the elven script in the rare cases where it is written. Travelers usually learn Trian or Galadhrian. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Malaccar Tigranos. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Many Roarians believe their race is underestimated by the outside world. Many Roarians adventure to prove that their race is just as powerful as the others are. Many Roarian adventurers seek profit, or merely to pit their skills against the outside world and then return in triumph to their homeland.

<h4 class="title"><a id="knight"></a>Knight Adventurer</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The knight adventurer is Galadhur's response to the need for armed defenders of the realm. The adventuring knight is loosely speaking a representative of the government. In other words, they have the permission of the King to maintain order, to defend the land, to succor the needy, to punish the transgressor and perpetrator of evil. They are sworn to uphold a code of honour. 
    </p>
<p>The Core Hold of Knights is an institute that attempts to educate and train the adventuring knights. Many indeed of the adventuring knights at large are graduates of the Hold. But, not all. The only qualification necessary to be an adventuring knight is to add one's name to the list in the Hold. That, and to recite the code, which is short and simple. However all know that knights who go errant are hunted down relentlessly and rendered against the Core. So, most every knight adventurer is a good knight, and honest and proud of their position. 
    </p>
<p>Those knights adventurer who are graduates of the Star may wear the symbol of the shimmering star on their arms and this is the most important badge of respect. But in some cases knights gain their own respect and that of the people as well without attending the Hold. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventures</strong></span>: Knights adventurer are free to go where they will. Sometimes they form bands and other times they adventure alone. Other times they find that it helps to join with groups with other talents. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Characteristic</strong></span>: Knights adventurer are known both for exploring and for steadfast honour and courage. It is this combination that makes them unique. They are a firm post of steadiness, and at the same time they are always seeking to go outwards to new things. Often they are philosophical, searching for the ultimate in moral truths, to expand their view of the ideal life, to improve their self. In any case they also seek to influence those they meet, at least through their own example of justice and honour. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment</strong></span>: Knights adventurer must be of neutral good (variant) alignment. Knights adventurer follow a code of conduct that stresses ethics and moral conduct. They would have the world be just, peaceful and prosperous, and look to spread this ideology to those whom they meet. One of the most important ways for them to do this is to live their own lives in such a manner. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion</strong></span>: The Core of Knights is non-secular. Their creed is humanistic and based on moral and codes that are drawn from real life, not from an abstract deity. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Background</strong></span>: Adventurers are glorified in Edion. Many youngsters dream of growing up to be a world explorer. Those who add a sense of morality to that dream tend to be attracted to the Star of Knights. If they are smart and strong enough, they may be taken on by the star as students and raised in the ways of the knight adventurer. 
    </p>
<p>While they believe that the strength of their steel should suffice in smiting the amoral and evil, they turn to magic to succor the needy. The true knight adventurer is a master of this kind of magic, and its mastery takes long and hard years of study combined with inherent wisdom. This study starts rigorously at the Star's School. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Races</strong></span>: Only Galadhrian Humans may be knight adventurers. Exceptions are exceedingly rare but a few dwarves and elves (and maybe even others) residing in Galadhur have been known to follow this path. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Other Classes</strong></span>: A knight adventurer can easily see the benefits of associating with other classes. However, they must always remember the code and a knight will not suffer to associate with one who flaunts their morals and philosophy. Knights adventurer tend to be wise, respected, and trustworthy, so they are often team leaders.

Strength is important because it improves their melee attack and damage rolls. Constitution is important for giving them lots of hit points. 
      </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment</strong></span>: Neutral Good. Actually it is a variant alignment that stresses just and ethical behaviour.

        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Overbear</strong></span>: Starting at 2nd level, knights adventurer can attempt to overbear their opponents. Overbearing is treated as a bull rush (see PH) except that the knight adventurer may attack while overbearing (either single attack or full-round attack). In addition, the knight is not subject to attacks of opportunity while overbearing. If the overbear fails, instead of being pushed back 5 feet, the knight provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Emboldening Courage</strong></span>: Starting at 3rd level, a knight adventurer's courage is so strong that it emboldens their allies as well. Whenever an ally is within 3 m of the knight adventurer, they gain a +4 moral bonus to their saving throws against fear.

See the Knight Adventurer's Mount sidebar for details. The mount must be a heavy warhorse or a heavy treehopper. Mount Empathy is a spell-like ability for knights adventurer that requires the use of a spell gem. 
        </p>
<p>In the case that the knight adventurer's mount dies, they can create an empathic link with a new mount. The knight must wait a month before attempting a new link.

        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Spells</strong></span>: Beginning at 4th level, the knight adventurer gains the ability to cast certain arcane spells in addition to their spell-like abilities listed above. These spells are listed on the knight adventurer spell table. The knight needs to have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level to cast a spell. Knights adventurer gain bonus spells based on their Wisdom score. Saving throws against their spells are DV 10 + spell level + Wisdom modifier. 
        </p>

        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong></span>: Upon reaching 4th level, the knight adventurer is able to take Weapon Specialization and related feats as though she were a fighter. (See the description for fighter in the PH.)

        </p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>Be honest, forthright, respect the property of others. Do not lie, cheat, steal or use poison. 
          </li>
<li>Act with honour and morality. 
          </li>
<li>In your deeds, serve and do not contravene the just and ethical authorities and laws. 
          </li>
<li>When able, quell public disorder, and stop crimes. 
          </li>
<li>Protect the lives and the property of those people you meet. 
          </li>
<li>Assist the needy whenever you meet them. 
          </li>
<li>When you profit by your adventures, return the profits to the Star, or donate them to just causes or charities. 
          </li>
<li>Be loyal and good to friends, allies, and just causes. 
          </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Associates</strong></span>: Knights adventurer seek allies who are good people. They value people with diverse talents who can assist them on their adventures. As long as the overall actions of their allies are good, knights adventurer are not overly concerned with their individual behaviour, unless it is obviously evil. Every individual is entitled to their individual code of ethics, as long as it is not evil. Knights adventurer do not adventure with characters who commit evil deeds, such as cold blooded murder, constant theft, flagrant violations of the code, etc.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Knights adventurer are not strictly speaking neutral good, since they believe in the supremacy of justice and ethics. However, if they ever grossly violate the code, fail to act ethically, justly and morally, or cease to be neutral good in a general sense (i.e. begin following another alignment), they are investigated by the Star as above, and they lose their membership and spell gems. In addition, they lose all of their special abilities except Overbear, if that has been gained. 
        </p>
<p>Knights adventurer who go astray may attempt to atone, this is a non-magical process governed by the Star. 
        </p>
<p>Knights adventurer are permitted by be multiclass characters but they face restrictions in this regard. Once the character begins gaining levels as a knight adventurer, she must stick to the class without taking levels in other new or existing classes. If they take a level in another class, they are no longer able to take knight adventurer levels after that. However, they retain their knight adventurer abilities. The heart of a knight adventurer must be dedicated and true.

      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Empathic Link</em></span>: The knight adventurer may communicate empathically with the horse. The maximum range for this ability is one kilometer. They can exchange simple emotional impressions and very basic commands. Impressions include happy, hungry, scared, and commands may include come here, run away, fall back. In addition, while mounted, the knight may guide their mount empathically. They do not need to use their knees or make a Ride check in combat (see Ride Skill, in the PH) 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Alertness</em></span>: Through the empathic link, the knight gains the benefit of the mount's sharper senses. While in physical contact with the mount, the knight gains the benefits of the Alertness feat. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Share Spells</em></span>: Through the empathic link, at the knight's option, they can include the mount in the effect of any spell they cast on themselves. The knight must have physical contact with the mount when they cast the spell, and if the contact is broken during the duration of the spell, the spell ceases to affect the mount and will not affect it again for the duration of that spell. The knight can also affect the mount with a spell with a target of "You" (as a touch range spell) instead of themselves. Sharing spells works even if the spell doesn't normally affect creatures of the mount's type (animal). 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Spell resistance</em></span>: The mount's spell resistance equals the knight adventurer's level +5.

To cast a spell, a sorcerer must have an Intelligence score of 10 + the spell's level. A sorcerer gets bonus spells based on Intelligence. The Difficulty Class of a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the sorcerer's Intelligence modifier.

<p><span class="bold"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Familiar Empathy</em></span></strong></span>: A sorcerer can create an empathic link with a familiar. Familiars are available for purchase in most major cities and from most magic schools for 100 gp. A familiar is a more intelligent version of a small animal (see the sidebar). The creature serves as a companion and servant. Familiar empathy is a spell-like ability for sorcerers that requires the use of a spell gem. </p>
<p>If the familiar dies, or the sorcerer chooses to dismiss it, the sorcerer must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15). If the saving throw fails, the sorcerer loses 200 experience points per class level. A successful saving throw reduces the loss to half of that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point total can never go below zero. A sorcerer must wait a month before attempting to create a new link with a new familiar. Slain familiars can be raised from the dead just as characters can, but do not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.

<p>Sorcerers in Edion may create an empathic link with certain animals. Familiars are normal animals that have been specially trained or bred to serve as a familiar for a sorcerer. When they link with the familiar, sorcerers are able to bestow special abilities on the familiar, and some familiars grant special benefits to the master as well.

<p><span class="bold"><strong>Familiar Ability Descriptions</strong></span>: Sorcerers bestow special abilities on their familiars depending on the level of the master as shown in the table above. The abilities are cumulative. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Alertness</em></span>: The presence of the familiar sharpens its master's senses. While the familiar is in physical contact, the master gains Alertness. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Improved Evasion</em></span>: If the familiar is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw, and half damage even if the saving throw fails. Improved evasion is an extraordinary ability. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Empathic Link</em></span>: The master may communicate empathically with the familiar. The maximum range for this ability is one kilometer. They can exchange simple emotional impressions and very basic commands. Impressions include happy, hungry, scared, and commands may include come here, run away, look around. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Touch</em></span>: Once the master reaches 3rd level, the familiar can deliver touch spells for the master. When the master casts a touch spell, they can designate their familiar as the "toucher". The master and the familiar have to be in contact at the time of casting. The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As normal, if the master casts another spell, the touch spell dissipates. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Speak with master</em></span>: The familiar and master can communicate telepathically when they are in physical contact. The familiar's ability to communicate and understand is limited by its low intelligence. Because they are animals, familiars see the world differently from humans. This is a supernatural ability. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Spell resistance</em></span>: The familiar has spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Casting a spell in Edion is similar to standard D&amp;D. The main difference is that spells are stored in spell gems, gemstones of high quality that act as the container and focus of the spell 
    </p>

</div>
<p>Sorcerers in Edion may cast any spell that is in their repertoire. These are the spells that an Edionic sorcerer is considered to know. The sorcerer may carry spell gems for other spells, but since they are not part of their repertoire, the sorcerer cannot cast them. 
    </p>
<p>Spells slots, casting time, range, aiming a spell, saving throws, spell results, and duration are all as given in the standard rules in the PH.

<p>Components are handled in Edion differently than standard D&amp;D. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>V (Verbal) and S (Somatic)</strong></span>: These components are typically handled as given in the PH. All official magic schools teach the spells as given in the PH, so if verbal or somatic components are noted there, they are required in the official versions of the spells. However, in Edion it is possible to remove the verbal and somatic components from the spells with no penalty to the spell's level. This requires normal spell research as given in the rules. Copies of such spells may be available on the black market. However possession or casting of such spells is illegal in Edion. </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>M (Material)</strong></span>: Material components are not required in Edion. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>F (Focus)</strong></span>: The spell gem serves as the focus for all spells in Edion. It must be in hand or carried by the spell caster. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>DF (Divine Focus)</strong></span>: There are no divine focuses in Edion (since there are no divinities). 
    </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unlike sorcerers in the standard D&amp;D rules, Edionic sorcerers must store their spells in spell gems. In many ways the spell gems function like the wizard's spell book in the standard rules. The standard rules are changed in the following ways: 
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>The various spell gems an Edionic sorcerer possesses act in most ways like the pages of a wizard's spell book.
      </li>
<li>A sorcerer in Edion interprets and records spells in their spell gems instead of reading and writing them in a spell book. From the perspective of the rules, the processes involved are almost identical 
      </li>
<li>An arcane writing in the D&amp;D rules is called a stored spell. 
      </li>
<li>Writing is called recording.</li>
<li>Reading is called interpreting.</li>
<li>Deciphering spells remains the same, although different faculties are used. In Edion, the sorcerer uses their magic organ to record and interpret spells, instead of their eyes and hands. 
      </li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2392592"></a>Adding Spells to a Spell Gem</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Edionic sorcerers can add new spells to their spell gems through several methods. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Spells Gained at a New Level</strong></span>: Sorcerers perform certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time the sorcerer achieves a new level, they gain two spells of their choice to add to their spell gems. These spells represent the results of their research. The two free spells must be of levels the sorcerer can cast. </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Spells Copied from Another's Spell Gems</strong></span>: A sorcerer can also add spells to their spell gems whenever they encounter a new spell in another sorcerer's collection. No matter what the spell's source, the character must first decipher the magical record. Next, the sorcerer must spend a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, the character must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell's level). If the check succeeds, the sorcerer understands the spell and can copy it into their spell gems (see Recording a New Spell into a Spell Gem below). The process leaves a spell gem that was copied from unharmed. 
    </p>
<p>If the check fails, the sorcerer cannot understand the spell and cannot attempt to learn it again even if they study it from another source until they gain another rank in Spellcraft. If the check fails, the character cannot copy the spell from another's spell gems. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Independent Research</strong></span>: A sorcerer also can research a spell independently, duplicating an existing spell or creating an entirely new one. The DMG has information on this topic. 
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2491681"></a>Recording a New Spell into a Spell Gem</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once a sorcerer understands a new spell, they can record it into their spell gems. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Time</strong></span>: The process requires one day plus one additional day per spell level. Zero-level spells require one day. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Space in the Spell Gem</strong></span>: A spell gem can store one spell level per 100 gp of value. A 0-level spell (cantrip) only requires a 50 gp gem. More than one spell can be stored in a valuable gem, but each spell must fit entirely within one gem. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Materials and Costs</strong></span>: The only material required is a spell gem. A spell gem can be any gem with a value of 50 gp or more. Each 50 gp of value allows one 0-level spell (cantrip) to be stored in the gem. For 1st level spells and above, each 100 gp of value allows one spell level to be stored in the gem. Thus, a gem worth 400 gp could store one 4th level spell, or two 2nd level spells, eight 0 level spells, and so on. 
    </p>
<p>If a sorcerer doesn't have appropriate empty spell gems available when they gain a new level and new spells for free, the spells are gained when the sorcerer obtains suitable gems. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Insufficient Gem Value</strong></span>: The actual value of the gem is used by the DM for the purpose of determining if a spell will fit in the gem. If the gem is not of sufficient value to store a given spell, recording the spell will fail. The time invested in storing the spell is wasted. After a failed attempt, the sorcerer gains an understanding of the actual value of the gem and how many levels of spells it can store. 
    </p>

<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2506557"></a>Finding Lost Spell Gems</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Should a sorcerer lose one of their spell gems, they can use their magical faculty to locate it if it is nearby. By concentrating, the sorcerer can sense the direction of their spell gem as with the <span class="emphasis"><em> locate object</em></span> spell. The range of this ability is 50 m. This ability only works for spell gems the sorcerer created themselves, and it only works while concentrating. </p>

<h4 class="title"><a id="id2388262"></a>Replacing and Copying Spell Gems</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A sorcerer can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost spell gem. 
    </p>
<p>Duplicating an existing spell gem uses the same procedure as replacing it, except that the task is much easier. The time requirement is halved.

<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2388282"></a>Changing Repertoire</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sorcerers may carry and understand as many spells in their spell gems as they wish. However, at any time only a limited number of these spells may be in their repertoire. Normally this repertoire is fixed and cannot be changed, even if the sorcerer adds a new spell to their spell gems. 
    </p>
<p>However, when the sorcerer gains a new level, they may change their repertoire as they wish. They must have a spell in their spell gem set before they can add it to their repertoire. 
    </p>
<p>At all times, the sorcerer's repertoire can be no larger than given on the Sorcerer Spells Known table in the PH.

<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2388312"></a>Daily Readying of Spells</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each day, sorcerers must focus their minds on the task of casting their spells. A sorcerer needs 8 hours of rest, after which they spend 15 minutes concentrating. During this period, the sorcerer readies their mind to cast their daily allotment of spells. Without such a period to refresh themselves, the character does not regain the spell slots they used up the day before. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Recent Casting Limit</strong></span>: Any spells cast within the last 8 hours count against the sorcerer's daily limit (as per wizard in the PH).

<h3 class="title"><a id="limitations"></a>Limitations on Magic in Edion</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A few general principles are in effect to govern magic. These restrictions stem mainly from the total internal consistency that is a governing principle in the design of the campaign. The technological level of the campaign is medieval. These principles serve to generally remove from the 3E magic system any spells that, if taken to their logical conclusion over a long period of time, would take it beyond a medieval technology level. Thus the intent is that even very powerful magic users in Edion are restricted to what can be considered normal medieval constraints.
  </p>
<p>So, many the following limitations each serve to enforce medieval constraints. Others reflect the lack of deities in the campaign or other factors.
  </p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>Both news and people travel slowly in Edion. No spell may permit instantaneous or unnaturally rapid travel or communication. Thus, the Conjuration school is prohibited. 
    </li>
<li>In Edion, maps are inaccurate and castles are not vulnerable from the air. No spell may permit high-altitude flight. 
    </li>
<li>No helpful yet unseen intelligences exist in Edion. No spell may allow the caster to know things that are not physically possible for them to know. Thus, the Divination school is prohibited. 
    </li>
<li>Minds are so complex that their manipulation is beyond the realm of current magic in Edion. No spells may affect the mind directly. Thus, the Illusion school is prohibited. 
    </li>
<li>Undead do not exist in Edion. Thus, all undead affecting spells are omitted. 
    </li>
<li>Living animals and intelligent beings are so complex that they require specialization to manipulate with magic. Thus, the Necromancy school is prohibited. 
    </li>
<li>There are no extra-dimensional spaces in Edion. 
    </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Exceptions to these principles are noted in the spell lists. 
  </p>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2388358"></a>Exceptions</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Regardless of these limitations, there may at times be observed seemingly magical effects that contravene the limitations outlined in this section. These may result from magical powers that are not generally available to characters in Edion.

<p>Any calendar must try to match the astronomical facts of the world. In Edion, there are 366.2324 days in each solar year, the time it takes for the sun to rotate around the world. There are also 42.34 days in each lunation, the time between each full moon. There is no perfect way to divide the days and months to match these periods, but the Elaran calendar approximates them with good accuracy.

<p>Each week in Edion has seven days. The first five days of the week are days of work, followed by the last two days which are holidays put aside for rest and recreation. In some parts of the world, only the last day is taken as a holiday.

<p>The first day of each month is always the first day of the week. The first eight months of the year (Faldir through Tiryar) have six weeks each; the ninth months has four weeks.

<p>The inhabited areas of the Alimides, including Edion and the many islands, have a tropical climate. Warm weather dominates year-round, although it is cooler in the highlands and moutainous regions. The average temperature is a hot 30Â° Celcius, and a cooler 20Â° C in the mountains.
      </p>
<p>Each year is marked by the passing of two rainy and dry seasons, following each in turn for about 100 days each. The dry seasons are not truly parched, as mild rainfalls still occur every few weeks. The rainy seasons are not quite monsoons, and floods are rare, but rain falls steadily all day along the coasts and every afternoon in higher areas.
      </p>
<p>On Edion, north of the Doromores is a vaste wasteland that receives little or not rain, and experiences frequent dust storms. It is an inhospitable place, potentially devastated by some ancient magical calamity.

<p><span class="bold"><strong>Shilara tree</strong></span>: This is a massive tree, growing to the height of 150 meters or more. It towers over all other living things. The lofty limbs of the shilaras support unique ecosystems that can only survive at different heights in the jungle. In particular, elves often live in the understory, the area below the canopy of the forest but 100 meters above the forest floors. The varied levels are known as the canopy, the understory, and the forest floor. Sometimes the area just beneath the canopy is called the attic.
        </p>
<p>The shilara is shaped like a beech, except with thicker, more granular bark. The leaves of the shilara are up to a half-meter across with a mossy growth at the base where it connects to the branches. Each leaf is shaped somewhat like a basin that is capable of catching rainfall and feeding it into the moss. There it is absorbed by the tree to allow it to maintain moisture so high above the ground.
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Violetroot</strong></span>: This is a common herb that even grows like a weed in widespread parts of the Alimides and the Trian empire. It is notable for being an oral contraceptive. Easily prepared, the effect of a dose of violetroot lasts for about a week.

<h5 class="title"><a id="id2500760"></a>Certified Spell Gems from the Common Market</h5>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Certified spell gems are available for purchase in most major cities in the Alimides from the local sorcerer's institution (academy, guild, school, etc.). Spell gems are sold only to spell casters, and typically a demonstration of this ability is required. 
      </p>
<p>Sorcerer's institutes usually sell spell gems to casters for 110% of the actual value of the gem. They generally guarantee the value of the gem. Prices may be higher in smaller towns and cities.

<p>Any gem may be used as a spell gem, but if the actual value of the gem is lower than the claimed value, spell storing may fail (see the section on recording spells in gems in the Magic chapter). The only way to determine the actual value is with a successful appraisal skill check.

<p>The Alimides is a vast sea region that includes the continent of Edion and a 
    large archipelago -- a group of islands -- that lies to the south of the continent. 
    The great landmass of Edion lies at the top of the archipelago. But the islands that
    make up the rest of the Alimides have almost an equal area of land, divided up among
    hundred of islands both small and large.

<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2500905"></a>Overview</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Edion is a roughly oval continent, stretching 4000 km across at the widest point, 
    east to west. There is a great deal of difference between the nothern half of the 
    continent and the south. In the north there is a wasteland of desert scrub that is largely
    uninhabitable. The northern coasts are difficult and there are few ports. A mountain range,
    the Doromores, cuts across the continent dividing north from south. South of the range, the
    environment is quite the opposite, a pleasant jungle with plenty of rainfall and 
    habitation.
    </p>
<p>Because the north of the continent is an uninhabited wasteland, we will speak of 
    the "east" and the "west" of Edion as actually the south-east and south-west of the
    continent. The east and west are divided (below the Doromore range) by another range of 
    mountains which builds up from foothills at the southernmost tip of the continent
    towards a great mass of peaks in the center. This is the Tikmurn range.
    </p>
<p>To the east of the Tikmurn range lies mainly jungle in which the elven nation
    of Elara makes its home. To the west of the range first lies the Edion Forest, the 
    deepest and most mysterious jungle of Edion. Beyond that is the open space of the 
    Filgreen coast which lies around the edges of the massive Bay of Bromar, which
    reaches inward almost to the Doromore mountains. Beyond the bay is the other side of
    the Filgreen coast and another range of mountains, the Atlars, which clutters up the entire
    western end of the continent.
    </p>
<p>Of these western lands, the Edion Forest is home to a cult of elven druids who
    keep out all intruders. The Filgreen coast and the Bay of Bromar is the domain of the
    humans of Galadhur. The Atlar moutains north and west of the bay, at the western end of the 
    continent and the Doromore range, are occupied by dwarves. Elara and Galadhur are important
    enough in their own right to be detailed in a separate section.

<h4 class="title"><a id="id2422070"></a>The Filgreen Coast (area)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Filgreen Coast is a wide and fertile crescent of land that surrounds the Bay of Bromar.
    It is on this coast that most of the territory of Galadhur lies.
    </p>
<p>In contrast to the rest of southern Edion, the Filgreen Coast is mostly open and flat. 
    Most of the area is taken by agriculture, with fields of wheat, rice, beans, etc., growing
    abundentdly after the rains. A substantial minority of the land is covered in forest retained
    for hunting.

<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2422093"></a>Galadhur (nation)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Galadhur a major nation of Edion that occupies most of the region known as the Filgreen
Coast. Despite the easy living at home, Galadhrians have turned their interests abroad, to
trading and exploration. Education is free, and the country maintains a powerful navy easily
the match of any other in the Alimides.
</p>
<p>Part of the mystique of Galadhur is its early days of exploration. It is Galadhrians 
who first explored the myriad seaways of the Alimides, forging the network of trade that links
the whole region. Perhaps because of living on the Bay of Bromar, Galadhrians feel the pull
of the ocean to carry them abroad. Most foreign trade in the Alimides runs on Galadhrian
ships. Galadhrians carry packet mail from island to island. Galadhrians protect the seaways
from occasional pirates and sea monsters.
</p>
<p>The home port of Galadhur and its capital is the city of Freeport, a lively mix of
natives and foreigners there to trade and learn. There is a strong independent streak in
Galadhrians, and the city of Freeport in many ways considers itself independent of the 
whims of the nation. Still, overlooking the city from a tall promontory is the famous 
castle of Galadhursild, the name-sake of the nation and the royal seat.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sandwiched between the Filgreen Coast and the central Tikmurn mountains lies a vast, dense jungle called the Edion Forest. Little is known about the Forest except that it is the domain of a collection of elvish druids. These powerful magicians practice their arts with an aim to keep the forest clear from human interference. Thus, few enter the forest and even fewer leave it. It is said that the elves can see through the eyes of woodland animals and that no one enters the woods without their knowledge. It is also rumoured that at the heart of the forest lies a major druidic city where the druids live in Shilara trees, the source, apparently, of their power.

<h4 class="title"><a id="elara"></a>Elara (nation)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Elara is elven homeland. Elves have dwelled here since before time began ... at least
    before recorded history began. And since elves have the longest records of any culture on
    Edion, that's a long time.
    </p>
<p>
    The elves live in the heights of massive Shilara trees, a hundred meters above the jungle
    floor. Although dangerous predators lurk on the surface, up in the understory of the forest
    that covers the country, it's relatively safe. Still, most Elarans go about their daily
    life with a knife at their belt. They also carry featherfall gems that give them one free
    trip down to the forest floor should they fall.
    </p>
<p>
    Elaran culture is civilized but the elves still live in close proximity with nature. They
    have mastered the art of magical gardening, and their gardeners can shape plants over long
    periods of time into houses, buildings, and even vine-like paths between the trees. Most
    Elarans live and work in domiciles that are actually living plants, slowly nurtured into 
    their present shapes over dozens of years.
    </p>
<p>
    The lengthy elven lifespan dictates a calm pace of life in Elara. Most of the elves life
    to be five hundred years or more. Thus elves will not blink an eye at an endeavour of 
    gardening of otherwise that takes decades to accomplish. The country is covered with ancient
    but still functioning works of magical architecture that have been built up over many 
    millenia.
    </p>
<p>
    Since the jungle is so abundant with wildlife and fruit and vegetables, the elves need spend
    little of their time of the basics of life. This leaves most elves ample time to pursue their
    personal interests, whether this is in crafts, intellectual, or spiritual matters. Elarans
    are a highly educated and advanced people. Their cities are jewels of civilization. Most
    elves have spent at least a decade in school, and are free to pursue artistic or arcane arts.
    </p>
<p>
    Elara is made up of five major provinces. Each has a different character and flavour. The
    most mysterious is Ceylar, a hidden realm in the northwest of the country. The others admit
    foreigners with varying levels of welcome.
    </p>
<p>
    Of the three major cities, Arcos is by far the most international. It is the Elaran city of 
    trade and here large populations of humans, halflings, roarians, and even Trians can be found
    living beside the elves. Next in welcoming outsiders is Sheliar, the capital city of Elara.
    Although it is near the coast, it is dominated by elves. Miriar is Elara's internal city,
    far up the Epian river and mostly closed to outsiders.
    </p>

<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="ceylar"></a>Ceylar (province)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Easily the most xenophobic and secretive elves of Elara, Ceylarans are also the most
distinctive due to their dark, almost black, skin. Still, they are rarely seen by other elves, 
as they sequester themselves in the mysterious province of Ceylar. By their own design, 
Ceylar has wrapped itself with a protective mantle of magical beasts, through which none may pass.
Their permission is rarely -- if ever -- given.
</p>
<p>Ceylar occupies a central position in the continent, abutting both the Doromore and
Tikmurn ranges in the north-western corner of Elara. The land is high, and much of it is
a cloud forest, misty almost all the time. There is a magical barrier that surrounds the
territory, a zone in which a variety of dangerous monsters are held in order to prevent
intruders from passing into the provice proper. These monsters are referred to as the 
"watchers". That they are magical beasts is indicated by reports of blue, glowing eyes
from a few brave or foolhearty intruders who have survived to tell the tale.
</p>
<p>As for what lies within the province, it is difficult to say. Many speculate that
it is a vast trove of historical knowledge, as the Ceylaran life-span is rumored to be
upwards of 2000 years. Bolstering this argument is the indisputable fact that Ceylaran
elves periodically leave their homeland to involve themselves as advisors in the 
politics and international dealings of Elara. They usually provide indispensible perspective
and advice.

<p>Arcos is the most international city in Elara. It is a bustling port, full of foreigners meeting for trade, politics, or simply passing through. Some consider it the most important port in the Alimides, since it is more centrally located than Freeport.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Arcos is situated on the bank of the river Amaderian about 10 km from the coast. The city slopes gently up from the river bank. It sits at the end of a strip of open land that hugs the shoreline of the ocean for some distance to the east. Open land also continues north up the river for another 10 km before giving way to the jungle. 
      </p>

<div>
<div>
<h5 class="title"><a id="id2393002"></a>Landmarks</h5>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The city proper is encircled by a town wall that dates from the Alimidean war many years ago. Inside the wall the major landmarks include the provincial palace, the opera house, the international market, and the Tree. 
      </p>
<p>Arcos is an ancient and beautiful city. Many of the structure are thousands of years old. The Arcosian style is sleek. The quality of materials is very important to the city's architects and artists. 
      </p>
<p>The resident community of elves tend to live in the elven quarter which is separately walled although access is freely given to anyone and there are many gates. The quarter is distinguished by a veritable garden of flora hanging from roofs, growing out of pots, and clinging to walls. Many of the buildings here are very tall, and made from living rock or live trees. 
      </p>
<p>The international quarter is the home to many of the foreigners living in the city. The international market lies on the edge of this quarter, near the center of town, and during the daylight is always busy with people. Parts of the international quarter, like the Galadhrian district, are neat and ordered, while others, like the Trian district, are maze-like hives that upright citizens avoid at night. Most of the international quarter is walled and at night the gates are staffed by guards. 
      </p>
<p>The royal quarter surrounds the provincial palace and is home to a variety of people of various races, and many institutes, schools, and temples. 
      </p>
<p>The docklands along the river is full of warehouses, merchants, and sailors from all over the world. It is well patrolled by the city guard. 
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h5 class="title"><a id="id2393060"></a>The Tree</h5>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Tree is a massive tree-shaped structure of living rock. Hundreds of dwellings are perched on the branches or formed out of the rock. It is covered in live plants so that it looks from a distance like a huge living tree. The Tree houses a hodgepodge community of elves and foreigners who are bohemians, nonconformists, or lead slightly shady lifestyles. The Arcos guard doesn't enter the Tree, but the inhabitants have a live and let live code that doesn't suffer violence. 
      </p>
<p>Traveling about the Tree is a matter best left in the hands of a guide. Its ways and byways are confusing and three-dimensional. Most inhabitants carry feather-fall gems for safety. 
      </p>
<p>At the base of the Tree is a preserve that is left in a state of native jungle. Except for the path that leads to the stairs and skywalk up to the branches, the area that falls in the shadow of the tree is dangerous at night due to predators. 
      </p>
<p>The preserve is surrounded by a high wall and there are only two entrances to the Tree from ground level, one to the stair and the other to the skywalk. The gates are guarded at all times by the Arcos city guard.

<h4 class="title"><a id="sheliar"></a>Sheliar (city)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sheliar is the capital city of Elara. It is a busy city, with a thriving dock trade that takes care of shipping towards the east with Roaria and the Trian empire. Merchants from Freeport, the Alimides, Roaria, and Tria gather at the dockyards to trade elven crafts, spices and herbs, and rare animals. As the national capital, the city also hosts several of the most majestic buildings in Elara.
    </p>
<p>The Elaran Royal Palace dominates even the spires of the Bishic temples. The palace is walled with white stone that extends around the entire citadel. The walls, spires, indeed the entire palace is made from the same white stone, seemingly from a single rock, as there are no seams or cracks to be found in the entire structure. Spires, carved delicately to resemble natural plants and trees, rise hundreds of metres from the complex, and sprout delicate stone carved branches which shimmer in the daylight with the reflections from thousands of golden leaves. Inside the palace walls, surrounding the citadel is a garden of elaran delights: tropical flowers and fruit-bearing trees.
    </p>
<p>The elves of Sheliar are widely concerned with the affairs of world trade,  governance and conflict. They welcome the presence of humans and other races in their midst, since the traders and visitors bring with them a wealth of news of foreign affairs. Despite their interest in the visitors, however, Sheriarites tend to avoid close relations with other races, since they (rightly by comparison, most of the time) regard them as short-lived, emotional, and violent. However there is a deep-rooted ambivalence to this attitude in the city, and a thriving population of elves who mix, marry, and live freely with non-elves.

</div>
</div>
<p>Miriar is the traditional heart of Elara. It is the Elaran city that most closely mirrors the standard elven way of life: peaceful, slow-paced, and creative.
    </p>
<p>The population of Miriar is almost entirely elves. For other races, the interests and endeavours of rural elves proceed at a level of detail that can seem beyond belief. The attention span of an elf can last for days, months, even years, on a single aspect of a project or a single conversation.
    </p>
<p>Miriar is a forest city. Like most Elaran towns and villages, it is found off the ground, up in the branches of the huge trees that make up the Elaran jungle. Most structures here are grown and tended by arcane gardeners, so they are living buildings. They are connected by vine-like pathways and roads and range from just a few dozen metres off the forest floor, to high up in the attic just below the canopy.
    </p>
<p>What business is done in the city centers around fine crafts. Raw materials and finished goods trade hands here and pass in and out of the great craft schools where the lore of making jewelry, arcane gardening, weapon-making, wood-carving, gem-cutting, weaving, etc. are concentrated. Most elves practise crafts for interest rather than profit, but there is still a substantial trade due to the volume of output. In addition, the elves need foreign materials to practise certain attractive hobbies (like gem-cutting).

  Virtually each shaman has a unique god that they follow. All of the gods of DanbulÃ©,
  however, are seen as manifestations of the spiritual power that surrounds all things. 
  DanbulÃ© practices animal sacrifice and the shamans enter trances influenced by powerful 
  herbal mixtures where they can speak to the gods and channel their powers.

<h3 class="title"><a id="id2453604"></a>History of Edion</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The recorded history of Edion begins ten thousand years in the past in Elara
with the stories of Bish, a semi-mythical figure who founded the first monasteries in the countryside. Bish is also said to have introduced writing to the elves. Bish himself, is said to have been an elf who lived a long time, perhaps a thousand years. Eventually he travelled into Ceylar, which even in those days was a remote and xenophobic country. The circumstances of his death are unknown, and some speculate that he lives on to this day.
</p>
<p>It was many more thousands of years more before the elves of Eastern Edion joined 
together into a single nation. 
This occurred seven millenia ago, in the year counted today as 
<span class="emphasis"><em>-2242 BF</em></span>.
In that year, the individual nations of elves joined together and appointed a Council of Elders to govern their joint affairs. The individual nations became provinces of Elara.
</p>
<p>Around this time, two thousand years before the founding of Galadhur, the people of that nation were still in a relatively primitive state. There were three cultures living around the edges of the Filgreen Coast of Western Edion: the Wolds, Firs, and LÃ¤ns. These people were engaged in constant struggles of control over the fertile lands around the bay.
</p>
<p>In part the unification of the elves was a response to attacks on their 
territories by the LÃ¤ns, first, and then the Wolds. About one elf's lifetime 
after the nation was founded 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>-1767 BF</em></span>),
 the people of the Filgreen Coast, united under the Wolds, led an ill-fated invasion of 
Elara. They were easily repelled but the elves abhorred the incessent violence and 
decided to take matters into their own hands. They slaughtered half of the population 
of the Coast and mixed their blood with the Coasters in equal numbers. It was not 
long before virtually every human living on Edion had half-elven parentage. After a 
few hundred years (in the 
<span class="emphasis"><em>-1400s BF</em></span>) the elves withdrew.
</p>
<p>The elven blood had a fairly dramatic effect on the proto-Galadhrians. Despite being a subjugated people, they quickly developed a mastery of the arcane arts that is a benefit of elven ancestry. They also were pacified and ceased warring amongst themselves and on their neighbours.
</p>
<p>Instead the people of the Filgreen Coast turned to exploration as an outlet for their great creativity and outgoing natures. They developed impressive sailing vessels and soon had founded a strong economy on the basis of trade with the races and cultures they met in the surrounding sea region. After some time they grew to provide the elves (who had no love for the sea) with many products and services not otherwise available to them. Over time, a great friendship grew up between the two peoples.
</p>
<p>At last, a new nation of Galadhur was founded, starting a new era 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>0 FC</em></span>).
 The Founder's Count of years begins in this year, when the foundation stone of Galadhur-sild (the great castle of Freeport) was laid. The Galadhrians had spread the science of writing, originally learned from the elves, throughout the Alimides and had considerable influence on their neighbouring nations. It is for this reason that their years are used as the standard throughout Edion and the Alimides.
</p>
<p>The next thousand years were a time of peach and prosperity for the two Edionic nations. Traffic between them grew strong both along the coastal waters and roads that passed south of and even through the Tikmurn mountain range. With the assistance of the dwarves, a tunnel was built through the mountains as a shortcut for travellers.
</p>
<p>The opening of trade with Galadhur also greatly facilitated the trade of gems 
with the dwarves who lived to the north of Galadhur in the Doromore mountains. 
Although the Tikmurn dwarves were fine miners, their time ended not long after when they
were driven out by orcs 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>822 FC</em></span>).
 The Doromore dwarves remain steadfast suppliers of gems to the magicians of Elara.
</p>
<p>The end of this first Galadhrian millenia saw the descent of orcs from the center of the continent down the Tikmurn mountains to the sea, threatening both Elara and Galadhur. The orcs were easily held off by the elven mages and the dense Elaran jungle, but the Galadhrians fared less well in the western foothills.
</p>
<p>After a time 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>1077 FC</em></span>)
 a Galadhrian general arose to drive back the orcs. His name was Starc, and a city was named in his honour. Sad to say, it did not outlast his own life, as he died fighting a redoubled strength of orcs who overran the city only eighty years later. Since then, the humans have withdrawn and orcs have held a narrow stretch of land between Galadhur and Elara. Most traffic now passes by sea, and so elves rarely visit Galadhur.
</p>
<p>There was a brief war between orcs and Galadhrians around the time of Queen Stefine
(<span class="emphasis"><em>1833 FC</em></span>).
 A group of orcs united under a powerful chieftain gained the upper hand in a series of skirmishes and over the next fifty years, the eastern frontier of Galadhur was pushed back to the banks of the river Ingrid. It seemed as though a new kind of orc had appeared from the mountains to lead their lesser cousins who lived in the lowlands. A bold attack by the Galadhrians crushed the chieftains, and the two sides settled into an uneasy truce. Castles and garrisons are still manned along the river by Galadhur against the occasional raid or assault.
</p>
<p>Through the ebb and flow of time, the borders have changed little since then. For 
thousands of years Edion and the Alimides have been at peace, punctuated only by a 
brief assault on Elara by the Cardanites 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>3362 FC</em></span>)
that was swiftly broken.
</p>
<p>More recently, in the last five hundred years 
(<span class="emphasis"><em>4000s FC</em></span>)
 a new power has slowly arisen in the far East and begun to influence events in Edion. This is the empire of Tria, a vast power in a distant land that has begun to show an interest recently in Elaran affairs.

<p>The Adventurer's Guild is a powerful organization based in Freeport that promotes and protects adventurers worldwide. 
  </p>
<p>The Guild is founded on the principles of adventuring as idealized in Galadhur. Adventurers are people who embark on risky ventures to explore, to meet new people, to fight evil, and to find hidden treasure. Adventurers boldly go where no one else will dare, take on any task, risk their lives, and return to tell the tale.

<p>These animals are similar to light tree hoppers but are trained and bred for strength and aggression. They usually are not ready for warfare before age three. A light war tree hopper can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless they succeed at a Ride check (DC 10). 
      </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Carrying Capacity:</strong></span> A light load for a light war tree hopper is up to 230 pounds; a medium load, 231-460 pounds; a heavy load, 461-690 pounds. A light war tree-hopper can drag 3,450 pounds.
