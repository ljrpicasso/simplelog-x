<h2>a short story (2000)</h2>

<p>Later I regretted taking the job at Sony, because I can
never tell anyone about it.  I signed non-disclosure agreements before they
showed me any of the good stuff.  They quickly put the fear in me, casting in
to the shadows any thought I had about breathing a word about their secrets to
anyone.  I believe every word of the threats of dire repercussions if I talk. They
probably still have someone periodically checking up on me and my friends,
checking for traces of me blabbering about things I shouldn't have.</p>

<p>But at the time I didn't know any
better and I was excited as all hell about landing the job. I wanted to snag a
spot in the super-elite industrial design department, known to insiders as ID. 
Those are the folks who figure out what the product is going to look and feel
like.  They are artists in metal and plastic, toying with scraps of composites
and Styrofoam, making prototypes and testing them out for good curves, clean
closures, and smooth textures.</p>

<p>I responded to an ad on my school's
job board.  Software developer wanted to work on industrial design prototyping
at Sony.  I sent them my resume with its subtly curved lines and high-tech
font.  They responded by flying me to Japan for the interview.  As I walked into
the steel and glass building in downtown Tokyo with an escort from the airport,
I realized just how much money Sony really had.  I rose on the elevator to the
23<sup>rd</sup> floor of the building.</p>

<p>More short Japanese businessmen
greeted me and led me into a small conference room for the interview.  It at
least was a little homier — it didn't actually have windows overlooking Tokyo. 
The interview was pretty standard.  "Describe one thing about your last job
that was challenging for you.";  What I said:  I found it challenging to
understand how the new employers' systems worked.  Real answer:  hatred of the
morons I worked with.  "What accomplishment at work are you most proud of."; 
What I said: Creating a finished system that works well as a unit and that I
can point at and say, I made that.  Real answer:  slacking off and not being
noticed.  Needless to say, I'm good at doing interviews.</p>

<p>The Japanese boys seemed satisfied
after an hour and told me to wait in the room while they went and fetched the
person who would be my new boss for the second stage of the interview.</p>

<p>While I waited I played with the
tiny teacup they gave me, the only furnishing in the entire room.</p>

<p>Pretty soon a tall, lanky American
swarmed into the room. He shook my hand firmly and introduced himself as Jim
McGee. "Good lord, I hope Yanaka-san hasn't bored you to death,"; he said,
sweeping his eyes across the barren table.  "Let's get out of here.  I'll show
you up to our offices.  Want to see them?";</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon it became
clear that I was being offered a job.  Over sushi dinner with McGee and his
colleague Sara Okawa, they made the official pitch:  start tomorrow, seventy
thousand a year American, free housing and food.  Sounded pretty damn good to
me.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Needless to say, I went through a
bit of culture shock getting used to Japan.  For one thing, I was never a
natural with languages and despite the classes they forced me to take, I just
never caught on.  Fortunately I lived in an isolated world of mostly American
industrial design team so it didn't matter much.</p>

<p>After I signed the dreaded
non-disclosure agreements, the next day McGee took me into his office.</p>

<p>"Before I tell you anything about
what we're doing, first I have to give you a run down of how security works
around here,"; he said.  "First of all, you don't talk about the projects
outside of the offices on this floor.  You don't  even say the code-name of the
projects outside of the offices on this floor.  Don't even talk about them to
other people in the company.  Don't let anyone into the labs except yourself. 
Make sure everyone who comes with you is authorized and uses their card. 
Prototypes and finished products don't leave the lab.  Is everything clear?"; he
asked.</p>

<p>He must have read my mind, because
he answered my question  even though I was too frightened by the sudden tirade
to ask it.  "You're probably wondering why we're so secretive,"; he said with a 
frown.  "This department is the life-blood of the company. Our business is
founded on producing products that shock and amaze the world.   If the products
we're working on in here become public before we release them, we lose control
of our edge.  Worse, our competitors might pre-empt us with a copycat product
and steal our thunder.  Or, our customers and the media might work themselves into
a tizzy over perceived flaws and ruin the big shock of seeing such amazing
products.  What we want when we unveil the product is slack-jawed awe, not
cynical recognition.  That's what sells products and builds industry
leadership.  So, if you or anyone else in this department goes and blabs, it
ruins the product and damages the company, as well as hurting the consumers who
would have bought the product.  Besides the fact that we'll fire you and make
sure that you never get a job in industrial design again.";</p>

<p>I have to admit that I was scared
shitless.  He put the fear in me, alright.  But then he a hand on my shoulder
and said, "Look, I'm not trying to scare you.  I just want to make you
understand the seriousness of the information you're going to have access to
here.  It's very important to us that you can handle knowing details about our
products that you can't — ever — share with anyone.  Are you in?";</p>

<p>I nodded numbly and hoped that he
didn't notice my faintly shaking hands.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>After that, things got a lot more
relaxed.  Although it was always in the back of my mind, the
not-talking-to-outsiders wasn't that hard while I actually worked at Sony.  I
was surrounded by my coworkers on a day-to-day basis who knew all the secrets
as well so I could talk freely inside our offices and didn't have to watch my
tongue.</p>

<p>At first I was assigned to design
ASICs for Nova, a prototype DVD player that was eventually scrapped.  That broke
me in for another project that I was apparently hired for.  </p>

<p>At first I designed ASICs for a
prototype DVD player that was eventually scrapped.  That broke me in.  Then
they put me on another project, what I was apparently hired for. The project code-named
Tryst, so secret that we didn't even trust the rest of the company with the
code-name, and gave them a different one.</p>

<p>Tryst was unbelievable high-tech. 
I was amazed when I saw it.  The concept was so sci-fi that I couldn't even
believe they would have the temerity to even  think about doing it.  It was
fantastically crazy.</p>

<p>Basically what it amounted to was several
thousand PowerPC processors wired to a microfabrication engine.  The
supercomputer  made up of this processor cluster would churn numbers and every
few hours the engine would punch out a design based on the model in the
computer.</p>

<p>What made it fantastically crazy
was the software running on the supercomputer.  What made it ultra secret was
the software running on the supercomputer (and perhaps the existence of the
computer itself, which was in a class supposedly illegal for export from the
United States).</p>

<p>The software was a living
cybernetic network of nodes that contained the sum of aesthetic knowledge and
sensation that the gurus of industrial design had spent their lifetimes
mastering.  They would input an crude design into the modeling software, and
then each of the 1600 individual nodes would work on at a tiny piece of it,
perfecting it in every way it knew how, and then passing that bit onto the next
node, and starting on the piece it got from its other neighbour.  This process
would continue at blazing speed as the supercomputer processed the entire
model.  Then, it would increase the size of the pieces and start again. 
Finally, each of the nodes would see the whole model.  The supercomputer would then
declared its work over and stamp a copy of the resulting design on the microfab
engine for the humans to examine and scrutinize.</p>

<p>The room was scattered with
three-dimensional polycarbonate models of all kinds of former Sony products in
various stages of redesign.  The results of the process were impressive.  Not
stunning, but clearly the system had potential.  McGee's eyes lit up when he
came into the room and he picked up and turned the shiny models in his hand as
he described the new process.  Clearly he had high hopes for it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>My job was to refine the system and
take it to the next level.  To do that, I was to examine the software on a
node-by-node basis and make sure it accurately represented the industrial
designer's expertise.</p>

<p>I played with the software for a
week  and didn't think that approach would get me anywhere.  How I came up with
the solution is one of those strange twists of fate.</p>

<p>To begin with, various factors
intervened and I wound up with an out of the way office far from the busy labs
and most talkative designers.  McGee was reassigned in one of the interminable
reshuffles that seemed to plague the ID department.  My new boss didn't really
seem to know what I was working on and didn't care enough to see if he could
figure it out and get rid of me.  So, it happened that I had six months during
which I was left alone to my own devices and my computer screen.</p>

<p>Sometime during the second month
was when I had my breakthrough.</p>

<p>The main problem was trying to
figure out what the designers thought was good design.  First off, it was hard
enough for a junior member like me to corner them and quiz them about what they
liked and disliked, round versus sharp, smooth versus rough, shiny versus flat,
and so on.  Second, it just wasn't that simple.  What they liked and disliked
varied based on the context of the piece in relation to the entire product, the
synergy it had with other elements of the product, and sometimes seemingly the
weather or the quality of the coffee they had that morning.  Third, it became
clear that design wasn't something these people had learned, it was something
they were born with and had developed over their lives.  The task of building a
computer, a finite, unlearning machine, that could master their art, seemed
impossible.</p>

<p>So one day I was playing with some
silly putty, dreaming, when I suddenly had an epiphany.  What, I thought, if
instead of giving the computer a static, prebuilt set of aesthetic ideals,
instead I let it invent its own.  I could get it started with a few easy,
fundamental, basic rules of what makes an object  look good and let it go about
all the refining, learning, developing, and sophistication that makes a truly
great aesthetic.  I wouldn't have to interview the designers anymore, which was
a relief, because they were all kind of crazy.</p>

<p>So, I gave the computer some basic
concepts, like curves are good, balance is good, some basic color balance
scales and some rules about weight and size.  Then I put those basics into each
node, and allowed them to communicate between each other with tiny variations of
the basic set over time.  Now, when a variation arose that raised the overall
aesthetic value of that nodes' rule set, it would propagate through to its
neighbours. They would adopt the successful changes and spread them to their
neighbours, and so on.  Pretty the soon the cluster would be seething with good
design ideas spreading from node to node with all the veracity of a computer
virus.</p>

<p>At first it didn't seem to do much.
 No one was using the Tryst computer system, with all its 1600 processors and
microfabrication engine, since it had been forgotten in the turf wars. I let it
go for a few days on the original Walkman to see what would happen.  Out popped
a vaguely globular shaped design that didn't look like anything much to look
at.  On a whim, I loaded up an extra batch of silver substrate for the microfab
engine, left the system on and went to work on a side project my new manager
had been harassing me to do.</p>

<p>In retrospect I'd asked too much of
the system to hope that it would come up with anything useful with only a few
days to go with.  After all, the human brain takes years to master the arts,
and this supercomputer had only a fraction of our brain power, even though it
was all dedicated to the sole purpose of designing nifty products.  Leaving it
on was a stroke of good luck, leaving it on for a month even more so.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Actually I forgot all about it
until one day McGee came into my office holding a silvery blob of pure art.  He
was clearly excited.  There was a large coffee stain on his shirt.  He placed
the blob on my desk and said,</p>

<p>"Guess where I just was.";</p>

<p>I had no idea, so I told him so.</p>

<p>"The Tryst lab.  Do you have any
idea what that thing's been doing for the last month?  It's insane.</p>

<p>"I just went in there because I was
going to scavenge some of the parts for a new prototype, and I discovered a
pile of these,"; he said, waving at the silver blob, "lying beneath the microfab
engine.  Apparently, the thing's been punching them out for months.  All of
them based on the original Walkman design.  Look at it.  I mean, look at it!";</p>

<p>I picked it up and really looked at
it for the first time since he'd come into my office.  It was sleek and
beautiful.  It wasn't just beautiful, it was <i>gorgeous</i>.  
It wasn't just gorgeous, it transcended
gorgeousness.  It left gorgeousness behind and swam off into the heavens of
true unearthliness.  Simple and elegant, clearly based on the original walkman
design, but so much more, like each individual line had been stretched out to
infinity and made into a path to heaven, like each corner had been beveled by
angels until it had the perfect curve to pronounce grace, power, solidity, and
coolness.  I couldn't take my eyes off it.</p>

<p>After a long time, I looked back at
McGee with the same wild-eyed wonder.</p>

<p>"This is incredible,"; I said.</p>

<p>"It's crystalline,"; he said.</p>

<p>We ran together to the big boss's
office.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I guess that the power that the
silver blob had over McGee and I was tempered by the work we had already done
with design.  The boss, an executive with little artistic training, had no such
protection.  He sat in awe at his desk, arms and jaw slack, staring at the
silvery object we had placed in front of him.  After a half an hour it became
clear that he wasn't going to move on his own, so he pulled the object away and
out of sight.  His eyes cleared and he looked at us uncertainly.</p>

<p>"I don't know if I could bear to
sell that,"; he said at last.</p>

<p>We ran a few more tests with even
more spectacular results.  Too spectacular.  Eventually the designs arrested
even the most hardened industrial designers in their tracks for hours at a time
with their beauty, their angular grace, the way they seemed to flow and move
even as they stood still.  The objects no longer simply represented tape
players and recorders, they took on a life of their own and became beauty
itself, a nectar squeezed from the essence of the aesthetic and made real in
our lab.</p>

<p>Clearly we couldn't let the designs
out of the building.  The less design experience the viewer had, the less
protection they had from the pure essence of the Tryst designs.  One kid we
brought in off the street stood in a stupor for two days staring at a design
before we dragged him away, made him sign twenty sheets of legalese and paid
him tens of thousands of dollars to disappear and forget he'd even seen us.</p>

<p>Finally our boss half-heartedly
announced what we'd all known in our hearts from the first day we'd seen the
silver drops of beauty.  We could not release these product designs, now, or
ever.  They were too pure.  They were too much for the casual consumer.  The
world would not survive them.</p>

<p>So, the system was mothballed and
moved to a basement storeroom, the designs were melted down, and the team was
reassigned.  I lost interest in the work and quit a few months later.  Sony
kept all of the software and ideas that had gone into the system.</p>

<p>The curse is, I can't tell anyone. 
When I left I signed another non-disclosure agreement and took an awful lot of
money as compensation.  I guess that I should just forget about and move on.</p>

<p>But in the middle of the night, the
designs still haunt my dreams.  Sometimes I see them hanging before me,
tempting me, calling to me.  Dying to be made real.</p>

<p>Someday I won't be able to stand it
anymore.  Beauty will be made solid, again.</p>
