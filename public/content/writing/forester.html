<h2>a poem (2001-2002)</h2>

<p>This is a mythological poem that is also related to the Edion Campaign. 
I think the style might be called an "epic ballad". 
The first section is in iambic quadrameter. 
The second section is in iambic pentameter, and I think that meter worked better.

<h3>Once there was a forester</h3>
<p>who lived in north Grenhaur.
<br />He roamed across his lands and kept
<br />all the evil beasts at bay.
</p>

<p>He prosecuted poachers, and
<br />he kept the forest safe, so
<br />his lord could hunt and roam the land
<br />and entertain the visiting kings.
</p>


<p>The forester's name, it was Galdraung.
<br />He was a quiet man, and he
<br />was ugly too, with lanky arms
<br />a bent nose and little manners,
</p>

<!--Once there was a forester who lived
in North Grenhaur. He roamed both far and wide
across the dells and brooks of royal woods,
his charge, to keep the evil beasts at bay.

He prosecuted poachers, safe he kept
the forest in a state so that his lord
could entertain visiting king with hunts
for foxes, hares, fowl, and wild harts.

The forester was Galdraung. His face was ugly.
His arms were lanky, his nose was bent and manners
he had few. The forester was a quiet man
who went his ways by lonely paths.-->

<p>few friends in town, but he
<br />could walk so far and fast that he
<br />did never give a care to that.
<br />Galdraung was knowing of his faults,
</p>

<!--In town, his friends were few and far between,
but he could walk so far and fast that heeded
he did not to these his faults. 

He had few friends in towns and villages,
but he could walk so far and fast that little
heed he gave to that. He knew his faults.
But since he was most satisfied with life

deep in the woods, he kept himself to that
true track, and did not try to make himself
a friend to those in town. Instead 
for many a year he kept the forest safe.-->


<p>and did not try to fix them, for
<br />he satisfied was with his life
<br />deep in the woods, and many a year
<br />he kept the forest safe and kept
</p>


<p>but to himself, happy in
<br />his lonely way. Then one day
<br />a-passing through a thick copse
<br />of trees he passed a dell from which
</p>


<p>there sweetly came a gentle breeze
<br />that carried scent that never before
<br />had Galdraung smelt, and pause he did
<br />and sniffed the air there all about
</p>


<p>The scent was lilac in the spring,
<br />and drew Galdraung towards the dell
<br />which he observed from hidden post
<br />among the trees in the thick woods.
</p>


<p>And there he saw a beautiful damsel
<br />naked as he was upon
<br />the very day that he was born,
<br />frolicking in the little stream.
</p>

<p>Galdraung transfix-ed was, and stood
<br />as still as if a tree among
<br />the trees, with only locks of hair
<br />stirring in the gentle breeze.
</p>

<p>He stood there and the maiden did
<br />not seem to see him among the trees.
<br />Galdraung did watch for hours there,
<br />or was it days? Time did not seem
</p>

<p>to pass. For certainly the sun
<br />was longer and the dell was hung
<br />in shadow by the time the maiden
<br />donned her gown and looked around.
</p>

<p>As her gaze did pass him by
<br />Galdraung a flinch could not avoid.
<br />He felt an arrow pierce his soul.
<br />Her beauty like a willow was,
</p>

<p>was like a birch, her skin was almost
<br />white, so smooth, her lips were thin.
<br />She had a look of sadness slight
<br />around her eyes, but even still
</p>

<p>her body had buds of beauty, like
<br />a lilac. She was slender and graceful,
<br />when she moved it seemed as though
<br />she left a trail of glitter dust
</p>

<p>behind her hanging in the air.
<br />As Galdraung flinched he rustled a branch.
<br />The maiden fixed her eyes on him.
<br />For a moment, she took a breath
</p>

<p>in sharp intake, then sprang away
<br />full like a doe. She ran away
<br />through densest woods, passing 'tween
<br />the trees, though barely leaving tracks
</p>

<p>her bare feet flying as she fled
<br />away, away, full from Galdraung
<br />who quickly made a hot pursuit.
<br />He could not let this maiden get
</p>

<p>away. She was the finest doe
<br />that he had ever seen, he must
<br />have her, smitten he was, by love
<br />that was instant, and would never leave him.
</p>

<p>As long as life in him remained
<br />Galdraung would love her, maiden in
<br />the woods. Her name Iselda was
<br />and she herself was elf-maiden
</p>

<p>come from the Deepest Forest, the Edion
<br />Forest, little known outside
<br />except to say that it is where
<br />no man could go and then return.

</p>
<br />
<a name="pentameter" id="pentameter"></a>

<p>She fled into the forest where she thought
<br />she would be safe, but seized with want Galdraung
<br />pursued, and in pursuing sealed his fate,
<br />for none have ever wandered in that woods
</p>

<p>and then returned; Galdraung knew well it was
<br />a journey he could never overturn.
<br />He followed her for many miles long
<br />and over brook, and under branch she led,
</p>

<p>by tree and bush, and ever just ahead
<br />of him she ran, as though she wished for him
<br />to follow but for him to never catch
<br />her up. Galdraung made chase, and though she like
</p>

<p>a doe was swift, a hunter used to long
<br />and tiresome jogs was he and he kept up.
<br />Before him he could ever see her gown,
<br />a glimmer of white 'mongst forest colours dull.
</p>

<p>The chase went on for weeks or months, or days
<br />perhaps. But though he never caught her up,
<br />always just in sight she was as ever
<br />eastwards she did fly, into the woods.
</p>

<p>More peril did he risk in following
<br />the farther into that strange wood he went,
<br />for he was stranger to this land and thus
<br />was barred from entering into it.
</p>

<p>Towards the mountains in the east she fled
<br />through deepest forest, here where giant trees
<br />did dwell. Then up the creepy crawling vines
<br />she sprang, to dance across the branches in
</p>

<p>the rooftop of the forest. Galdraung boldly
<br />followed. Risking life and neck, he sprung
<br />up after her and did pursue the maid
<br />ever upwards, ever onwards, towards
</p>

<p>the ancient peaks that did divide the east
<br />of this vast continent from west. She ran
<br />so lightly, almost like her footsteps never
<br />fell upon the branches, for never did
</p>

<p>they bend beneath her weight, so light she must
<br />have been, or else possessing power that
<br />Galdraung did not, for each branch bent below
<br />his weight. Some branches even broke: Galdraung
</p>

<p>plummeted down, but caught himself on vines
<br />or branches lower down and by his strength
<br />he climbed back up and ever followed her,
<br />his flower. Finally she reached the foot
</p>

<p>of hills and there she ran straight up the slope
<br />among the thinning trees, until she reached
<br />a rocky bluff, whereon she vanished 'tween
<br />two stones, as though she faded right away.
</p>

<p>Galdraung caught up and sat between the stones,
<br />howling. He had lost from sight his love,
<br />eternal flower, she who now that he
<br />had seen, he could but never again forget.
</p>

<p>He could no longer picture her in mind,
<br />but in that space there was an ache, so desperate
<br />real, that he could go no further, so
<br />he lay him down, there to the end await.
</p>

<p>Then there beside him, deep inside the nook
<br />between the rocks he saw a hidden crack,
<br />a fissure opening like a cave. Inside,
<br />a passage that lead down into the dark.
</p>

<p>He followed down, and there, at the last light
<br />in the last beam of light that pierced the cave,
<br />discovered a small shred of her white gown,
<br />that glimmered on the rock where it had torn.
</p>

<p>Now Galdraung made a whoop and calling out
<br />unto his love, he sped right down the shaft.
<br />Deep underground he went and in great haste,
<br />but without sight he fell down many times,
</p>

<p>but ever rose and ever continued on.
<br />Finally into a yawning chasm
<br />he plummeted. He had not seen it in the dark,
<br />and fell into the darkness, seemingly
</p>

<p>without an end and at the bottom struck
<br />a cold, hard water. All was at
<br />an end. He knew of nothing. Dreams did fly
<br />away and there was only coldness left.
</p>

<p>A few faint whispers haunted him, and faint
<br />illusions only did provide him with
<br />companionship. All was dark and all
<br />was silent, as never is heard above.


<br />
<br /></p>

<p>He stirred at last, and found that he was cold.
<br />With carefulness he opened up his eyes.
<br />He could but hardly see a thing, wherever
<br />he looked, the darkness, like a shroud, did veil
</p>

<p>him in upon all sides. He lay upon
<br />a hard, hard rock. 'Twas flat and perfect smooth,
<br />without a crack, and polished fine, and from
<br />the sound of a drip and drop he fully heard
</p>

<p>that water was nearby. The feel of wind
<br />both cold and fresh that blew upon his face
<br />did tell Galdraung that he was at the bottom
<br />of a well. The wind upon his face
</p>

<p>did tell him of a exit near at hand.
<br />But he cared not to think of leaving now,
<br />for in the darkness was a vision like
<br />a winsome maid, the very girl who nude
</p>

<p>before him had appeared in forest dell.
<br />The apparition moved with grace but shyness
<br />too, with fear but yet desire too.
<br />Around the edge of sight she moved about,
</p>

<p>But Galdraung was too weary still, his head
<br />was still on fire. In sleep the vision came
<br />close up to him, and bent above his head,
<br />her beautiful figure in glowing robes attired.
</p>

<p>Her cheek was white like satin is, her eyes
<br />like diamonds glowed, her breath a blossomy scent
<br />did bear, as though it was a warm spring breeze.
<br />She gently blew upon his frigid brow,
</p>

<p>and gently from his body fled the deathly
<br />chilling freeze. And it was like the smell
<br />of lilacs among the summer garden trees.
<br />As she breathed, then all his cares did ease.
</p>

<p>Now with a sudden start he woke! His limbs
<br />were fully charged, his strength renewed, he was
<br />refreshed. He felt like new. And suddenly
<br />right there he saw the vision was revealed.
</p>

<p>There was no ghost. The lovely maid was there
<br />in flesh, near touching him, then pulling away,
<br />and springing across the room, and disappearing
<br />down another secret passage, dark.


</p>

<p>He followed of course, what else could he but do?
<br />His heart strings pulled as if she held in hand
<br />those very strings, and as she drew away
<br />they tightened 'round and drew him up to stand.
</p>

<p>After her now, he entered in a maze
<br />with passages that led him round and 'round,
<br />and never signs did lead, each wall the same,
<br />yet on his heart strings pulled him, down and down.
</p>

<p>He drew at last into a cavern deep,
<br />and in the center sat the lovely maid,
<br />upon a pedestal high above the floor
<br />to which high place could be no passage made.
</p>

<p>Galdraung cried out, but she him paid no heed;
<br />she heeded none, for she sat all in swoon,
<br />her head was bowed, her dress was gathered round,
<br />and she was silent as the silver moon.
</p>

<p>Galdraung ran up and beat against the stone,
<br />the pillar tall and white that showed no crack,
<br />so smooth that he could gain no purchase on't,
<br />too wide for even his great arms to wrap.
</p>

<p>He bellowed out his love, but knew no words
<br />of sweetness, tenderness, fondness which could wake
<br />this maid so close to reach and yet too far
<br />from grasp, to roughly from her reverie shake.
</p>

<p>Anent he lay him at the base and he
<br />began to cry. Never since he had been
<br />a child had tears streaked down his check, nor had
<br />he ever felt such fear, such rending
<br />sorrow, since he left his mothers arms.
</p>

<p>His life since then had been indeed untouched
<br />by any fear, by any loss, by love,
<br />emotion; hard had been his heart, and cold.
<br />A dozen poachers in the woods he'd killed.
</p>

<p>In firm and lawful justness he had dwelt.
<br />Not once he looked into their dying eyes
<br />and saw the pain, not once he felt a pang
<br />against their suffering families, never guilt
</p>

<p>did sneak into his heart, for he was cold.
<br />And equally none had ever loved Galdraung,
<br />For who could love a man like him, low birth
<br />besides, but also cruel and heartless too.
</p>

<p>Upon all this Galdraung reflected him.
<br />It seemed the tears welled from his eyes for days.
<br />And maybe it was so, for as he cried,
<br />the tears beneath him formed into a puddle.
</p>

<p>And then the puddle turned into a pool.
<br />And then the pool did fill the cavern room.
<br />And then the pool became a lake. It rose
<br />around his ears, but still he cried and cried.
</p>

<p>As Galdraung cried the water lifted up
<br />his body till he reached the pedestal top,
<br />the lady sitting there. He clambered up
<br />but still she would not move. Her eyes were closed,
<br />she did not seem to breathe, was frozen still.
</p>

<p>So close to her, elated he became,
<br />but now he saw that she was still not his.
<br />She sat in frozen silence, and it seemed
<br />as though she would remain that way fore'er.
</p>

<p>The forester stared at her for many days,
<br />and still in all that time she never moved.
<br />Then moved himself he saw in all his life
<br />the sorrow and the pain that he had caused.
</p>

<p>He saw the meanness he had been. He could
<br />not right it. Never wrong but could he do,
<br />and never could he have her. Pity for
<br />himself was all he felt. In pity now
</p>

<p>a single tear welled from his eye and dropped
<br />upon the pedestal beneath her feet.
<br />And then a wondrous hap'ning did occur,
<br />as though the tear itself could magic work.
</p>

<p>At once, the pedestal began to melt
<br />away, from where the tear did fall; it faded
<br />until the stone was gone. And then what did
<br />occur? But so the magic spread so fast
</p>

<p>the maiden's leg and then her body whole
<br />grew gray, and then grew black. And then as though
<br />it were a snake's, her skin did break away,
<br />and fell into the water, hissing.
</p>

<p>Exposed beneath the skin was not as one
<br />might think, with horror on the mind, a sight
<br />of gruesome death, but rather beauty bright:
<br />a shining body lay beneath that skin.
</p>

<p>With all the weight now gone, the wearies of
<br />the world cast off, the black skin all curled up,
<br />dissolved into the tears, the light rose up
<br />and whirled about the room. It flew so high
</p>

<p>it cast its glimmer on the cieling high
<br />then swooping down set foot so light upon
<br />the surface of the lake that it did float.
<br />And then the figure bent to touch his face.
</p>

<p>She embraced him, sweetness, joy and love
<br />did him surround. Of a sudden he was standing
<br />on the ground once more, completely dry,
<br />and all the tears had faded from the room.
</p>

<p>The woman was before him once again,
<br />the maiden sweet. But this time she was glowing
<br />with an inner light as though beneath
<br />the surface dwelled a being of light. And there
</p>

<p>upon her face there was a glow that came
<br />from him. Surprised, he looked so quickly down
<br />to see himself now all aglow. A light
<br />Was shining through his skin. No longer ugly
</p>

<p>was Galdraung. Though ugliness remained,
<br />it mattered not. For he could see that under-
<br />neath there was a body of pure light.
<br />His body, and his light.
</p>

<p>In brightness all it shone, and he felt blessed,
<br />felt freed. For there about his body lay
<br />the blackened skin that he had shed, when all
<br />the tears that he had shed did fade away.
</p>

<p>The two embraced, and merged as one, and merging
<br />grew brighter ever than before had glowed
<br />two hearts. Indeed they merged into one star
<br />and slowly then they rose up from the floor.
</p>

<p>No strength to hold them in did now mere rock
<br />display, nor hidden streams; not soil, nor trees
<br />did cage them in, for up they rose through all
<br />of these, until they rose through empty air.
</p>

<p>Above the mountains rose their star, until
<br />they were so high that they could see the whole
<br />of Edion. The glimmer of starshine was
<br />their light, by which they saw quite soon indeed
</p>

<p>The ocean entire, and all the land in night's
<br />great splendour. High they were, so high that with
<br />their light they were now counted among the stars
<br />that glimmer ever on as jewels bright.
</p>

<p>There in the sky they did remain, and there
<br />they are today. A bright star to redeem
<br />cold hearted men and women everywhere
<br />and thaw their frozen hearts.
</p>

<p>For those unmov-ed people they shine on
<br />and hope them to inspire, and thus bring greater
<br />happiness to all the world, and they
<br />are known today as the star of Gladrung.
</p>

<p>For glad did ring the praises of Galdraung
<br />unto his love as they rose up, and still
<br />this night, they say, if listen you with care,
<br />then you can hear his praises if you try.
</p>
