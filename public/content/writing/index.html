<p>Here's a collection of stuff I've written. I suppose that the fiction is mainly
in the categories of science fiction and fantasy. The non-fiction currently doesn't
cover much ground.
</p>

<h2>Fiction</h2>

<p>
<a href="bat.html">What is it like to be a bat?</a>
- Perhaps you've heard of the 
<a href="http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/Nagel_Bat.html">
famous paper by Nagel</a>.
This is a sci-fi fiction based on that idea.
</p>

<p>
<a href="tryst_temptation.html">The Tryst Temptation</a>
- 
a sci-fi short story (c. 2000). It's definitely influenced by
the shocking level of secrecy at Apple.
</p>

<p>
<a href="forester.html">Forester</a>
- 
It's a rather lengthy Fantasy (sci-fi/fantasy that is) poem (c. 2001).
It's my only attempt ever to
write a long poem with consistent rhyme and meter (OK, mostly just meter).
I switched meter in mid-poem and never went back, so I think that the part
<a href="forester.html#pentameter">
starting with "She fled into the forest where she thought"</a>
is really much, much better.
</p>

<p>
<a href="strangemeeting.html">A Strange Meeting</a>
-
This person read this story I wrote (1996) and said she thought I would be a
writer someday. But I think she just said that because she liked me.
Anyway, it's a short story in the fantasy genre.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/about/errdoc.html">The 404 page</a>
-
This isn't even properly working as a 404 page, but it's supposed to be funny.
I think that it isn't really that funny.
</p>


<h2>Non-fiction</h2>

<p>
<a href="introduce.html">Let me introduce myself</a>
- from the perspective of a dolphin (but it's non-fiction, I promise).
</p>

<p>
<a href="dolphins.html">Dolphins: Is there intelligent life on Earth?</a>
- 
When I'm going to talk about dolphins, and specifically whether or not they are intelligent,
I start to wonder what exactly I mean by intelligent. For example, dolphins have never invented
fire or tools. This is more or less obvious because they live in water, and have no hands,
let alone opposable thumbs. Thus, some people who are interested in making contact -- with
aliens that is -- don't really care much about dolphins. ...
</p>

<p>
<a href="GreekJulianAcculturation.html">
The effects of Greek acculturation on the Julian solar calendar</a>
- 
If that sounds academic, well, guess what, it is (a paper for school).
There's some pretty interesting things about the Julian calender -- created in 46 BCE by
the namesake Julius Caesar. It was a massive reform and I traced back the calendar to the
Greek roots in its design. Of which there are plenty. Which is important because it was 
a course on acculturation (the mixing of cultures). And incidentally we still use the
Julian calendar, two millenia later with only slight alterations.
</p>


<h2>Journalistic</h2>

<p>
<a href="imprint.html">Imprint articles</a>
- 
For most of the time I was at university in Waterloo
I wrote for the student paper
<i>Imprint</i>.
I decided to document all the articles, so this is a big link list.
