<h4 class="title"><a id="galad"></a>Humans of Galadhur</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Galadhrians are an ancient race of humans from the area around the Filgreen Coast. They have always been known for their unquenchable desire to explore and their epic adventurousness. To this they add their elven characteristic of practicality and patience. The Galadhrians are a powerhouse of adventurers and traders abroad, but inhumanly stable at home. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Galadhrians typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Their skin is tan, their hair is often curly though straight is known, and facial hair on men ranges from sparse to thick. Galadhrian dress is usually practical and durable, though any number of styles may be seen. Galadhrian humans usually mature at age 20, and often live in excess of 150 years. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> These world travelers mix readily with any race. They are generally very polite, but sometimes this formality is mistaken for coolness. Galadhrians are found in every civilized corner of the world, but it is rare for them to settle down permanently outside of the Alimides. They often serve as merchants, traders, magistrates, and diplomats. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Galadhrians are most frequently good in alignment, and tend towards law or neutrality. Even the heroic adventurers of old were respectful of their nation's institutions. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Galadhrian Lands:</strong></span> Galadhur is a tropical country with rich soil for agriculture. Most of the nation is covered by rural farms and villages. The people tend to be peaceful and prosperous due to the regularity of the seasons. Around the Green Bay and along the coast, fishing is common. Trade is also conducted with the dwarves in the North, who virtually depend on the Galadhrians, and with the rest of the world through Freeport. 
    </p>
<p>Foreigners are common in the major cities of Galadhur, but rare in the countryside. Dwarves are often seen in the north, and traveling along roads to Freeport. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Galadhrians speak Galadhrian, which is also used in trading centers throughout the Alimides. Galadhrian has a written form that has existed for thousands of years, and is loosely based on the elven script. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Thurden.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Female Names:</strong></span> Buffin, Fraua.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Adventuring is Galadhur's national heritage. Galadhrians consider it a prestigious occupation. Adventuring is moderated by the Adventurer's Guild, a powerful extra-national institution based in Freeport. Galadhrians adventure for glory above all, as well as wealth and power.

</div>
<p>This description applies to Trians as well as the humans from Thiria and Eila (subject nations of the Trian empire). 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description</strong></span>: Trians typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Their skin is olive in colour, and their hair is curly and ranges through blonde, brown and black. Facial hair on men can be sparse or thick. Trians have short life spans, achieving adulthood at about age 15 and rarely living even a single century. 
    </p>
<p>Trians have unusual eye coloring. The colour of the pupil changes with their emotional state (like a mood ring). The pupil colours are given in the figure below. In addition, the sclera of the eye (usually called the "white") is black offsetting the colour.

</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations</strong></span>: Trians are an overbearing people who desire control and power. They do not possess the sense of goodness that is common in Edion and to a lesser extent in the rest of the Alimides. Tria is an empire that rules over many neighbouring nations including Thiria and Eila. The Trian empire is intended for primarily for the benefit of Trians, and thus it is not popular in some quarters of the world. Individual Trian imperial agents are treated with suspicion in the Alimides. Other Trians are usually assessed on their individual merits, but the lingering suspicion remains. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion</strong></span>: Trians worship a pantheon of gods. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language</strong></span>: Trians speak Trian, the language spoken throughout the Trian empire.

<h4 class="title"><a id="elves_of_elara"></a>Elves of Elara</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Elara elves don't change very much over time. An Elaran elf might do the same job, make the same decisions, for fifty or a hundred years. Then, all of a sudden, a sudden fever will strike and he will change occupations, renounce his former style of thinking, or travel to a new land. This phenomenon can strike at any moment, without any warning, but it typically only happens once or twice in an elf's life, it ever. Otherwise, elves are inhumanly patient, willing to spend decades growing a specific plant to a specific shape, or to while away weeks discussing a certain point of philosophy. 
    </p>
<p>There is another form of the fever, called the rage, which has been known to infect entire populations of elves. The rage spreads a single individual's ideology to large groups, like an air-born infection. This occurs only rarely, perhaps once a century at most, but the results are generally famous (or infamous). 
    </p>
<p>Elves are curious and literate. They hold beauty and the arts dear. They are eager to learn, but like an armchair historian often prefer to let someone else to the work. Still, the other races prize their knowledge of theory and philosophy. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Elaran elves shorter than humans, ranging from 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet in height and weighing from 90 to 150 pounds. While graceful in appearance, they have longer arms and shorter legs than humans, a feature well suited to their tree-based lifestyle. Still, their limbs are lithe and slim. Elaran elves generally have tan skin, dark hair and deep green eyes. They have no facial or body hair. They prefer simple, comfortable clothes, and they enjoy simple yet elegant jewelry. An Elaran elf matures when he reaches the age of about 100, and they typically live to an age of about 550 years. 
    </p>
<p>Elaran elves sleep normally but eat less than half what a humans eats. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> Elaran humans have great respect for the Galadhrian humans with their adventurousness and stability. They tolerate Roarians, valuing their martial skill. Trians are abhorrent to Elaran elves, but no elf would ever treat any individual Trian with less than neutrality. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Elves love stability, variety and beauty. They tend towards neutrality when trying to make these sometimes conflicting views work together. Elves are virtually always good, desiring a world in which everyone is happy. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Elaran Elven Lands:</strong></span> Elaran elves tend to live in dense jungle, where they make their homes high in the mid-levels and the canopy of the trees. They use their mastery of plants and their endless patience to shape their homes, towns, and roads from the very flora that surrounds them. The lush jungle amply provides game for hunting as well as fruit, fungi and other food plants unknown outside their lands. Thus most elves have ample time to work crafts and arts which they trade with the outside world for metals and other raw materials. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span> Elaran elves mostly are atheist. Bishism is a monastic order based on the principles first expounded by the mythical monk Bish. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Elves speak a fluid language of subtle intonations and intricate grammar. While elven literature is rich and varied, it is the language's songs and poems that are most famous. While Elaran is a poetic language, Elarans usually use Galadhrian for practical texts and with foreigners. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Athravian, Delatar, Elashar, Eochar, Farmian, Helman, Lellendrile, Nämian, Renian, Sorfar, Teridel.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Female Names:</strong></span> Anyana, Bindë, Emenë, Filmarë, Lyana, Rillenë, Themerya, Wylana.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Elves take up adventuring because of wanderlust, often following a bout of the "fever." Some elves adventure on a voyage of discovery, seeing themselves as brave explorers. Often elves also enjoy impressing the other races with their wisdom and martial skill.

<h4 class="title"><a id="roarians"></a>Roarians</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Roarians are fierce predators and patient enemies. It is therefore fortunate for the other intelligent races that they also tend to be somewhat lazy. Roarians enjoy the hunt but also enjoy sitting and observing. They tend to be more aware of immediate rewards than long-term concerns. A certain fatalism may be part of the reason why Roarians usually claim to be unconcerned with the future. However, many Roarians seem to believe that their lives is in fact a struggle against a dark fate, an attitude that may reflect their animalistic origins. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Roarians resemble tigers that stand on two feet. While they are humanoid, they have claws, sharp teeth, and are thoroughly carnivorous. Their skin is covered in orange fur, striped with black, and as a result most Roarians wear clothing only on their lower body. They are tall, ranging from 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet tall on average, and well muscled. Their eyes are yellow and cat-like and their faces are generally whiskered. Roarians mature a little faster than humans, at age 12, and usually live no more than 70 years. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> Roarians get along well with elves, who share their love of the jungle. However unlike elves they are heavily involved in the present and don't appreciate the elven esteem for tradition. Their relations with the Galadhrian humans is more strained, since Roarians consider personal ties more important than official ones. The Roarian attitude towards Trians is strained, but the empire has so far proven uninterested or unable to dominate the Roarian jungles. Roarians treat them with initial suspicion but warm rapidly to Trians who are not zealous for the empire. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Roarians are usually chaotic, and they are often neutral. Traveling or adventuring Roarians tend towards good, however, since they quickly shake off their jungle kill-or-be-killed attitude. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Roarian Lands:</strong></span> Roarians tend to live deep in the jungle. There they form clans and villages in loose relationships. Roaria is a wild and mostly untamed wilderness, thick with the species upon which the tiger-people prey. 
    </p>
<p>Roarians in human lands are often mercenaries, hunters, bounty hunters, rogues and smugglers. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span> Roaria has two dominant religions. Sédan is the dominant religion in the lowlands of Roaria, while mountain Roarians follow a mystical religion known as Danbulé. The lowland religion Sédan consists of a pantheon of gods representing natural features such as the sea, the forest, the sky, and so on. The most important deities are Rambula, goddess of the jungle predators and Vumjaa of the Rain. Danbulé is a polytheistic religion with an uncounted number of deities. Virtually each practitioner is known to believe in a unique deity. The gods of Danbulé however are merely manifestations of the spiritual power that surrounds all things. Danbulés practice animal sacrifice and enter trances influenced by powerful herbal mixtures where they believe they can speak to the gods and channel their powers. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Roarians speak Roarian, which uses the elven script in the rare cases where it is written. Travelers usually learn Trian or Galadhrian. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Malaccar Tigranos. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Many Roarians believe their race is underestimated by the outside world. Many Roarians adventure to prove that their race is just as powerful as the others are. Many Roarian adventurers seek profit, or merely to pit their skills against the outside world and then return in triumph to their homeland.

<h4 class="title"><a id="knight"></a>Knight Adventurer</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The knight adventurer is Galadhur's response to the need for armed defenders of the realm. The adventuring knight is loosely speaking a representative of the government. In other words, they have the permission of the King to maintain order, to defend the land, to succor the needy, to punish the transgressor and perpetrator of evil. They are sworn to uphold a code of honour. 
    </p>
<p>The Core Hold of Knights is an institute that attempts to educate and train the adventuring knights. Many indeed of the adventuring knights at large are graduates of the Hold. But, not all. The only qualification necessary to be an adventuring knight is to add one's name to the list in the Hold. That, and to recite the code, which is short and simple. However all know that knights who go errant are hunted down relentlessly and rendered against the Core. So, most every knight adventurer is a good knight, and honest and proud of their position. 
    </p>
<p>Those knights adventurer who are graduates of the Star may wear the symbol of the shimmering star on their arms and this is the most important badge of respect. But in some cases knights gain their own respect and that of the people as well without attending the Hold. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventures</strong></span>: Knights adventurer are free to go where they will. Sometimes they form bands and other times they adventure alone. Other times they find that it helps to join with groups with other talents. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Characteristic</strong></span>: Knights adventurer are known both for exploring and for steadfast honour and courage. It is this combination that makes them unique. They are a firm post of steadiness, and at the same time they are always seeking to go outwards to new things. Often they are philosophical, searching for the ultimate in moral truths, to expand their view of the ideal life, to improve their self. In any case they also seek to influence those they meet, at least through their own example of justice and honour. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment</strong></span>: Knights adventurer must be of neutral good (variant) alignment. Knights adventurer follow a code of conduct that stresses ethics and moral conduct. They would have the world be just, peaceful and prosperous, and look to spread this ideology to those whom they meet. One of the most important ways for them to do this is to live their own lives in such a manner. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion</strong></span>: The Core of Knights is non-secular. Their creed is humanistic and based on moral and codes that are drawn from real life, not from an abstract deity. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Background</strong></span>: Adventurers are glorified in Edion. Many youngsters dream of growing up to be a world explorer. Those who add a sense of morality to that dream tend to be attracted to the Star of Knights. If they are smart and strong enough, they may be taken on by the star as students and raised in the ways of the knight adventurer. 
    </p>
<p>While they believe that the strength of their steel should suffice in smiting the amoral and evil, they turn to magic to succor the needy. The true knight adventurer is a master of this kind of magic, and its mastery takes long and hard years of study combined with inherent wisdom. This study starts rigorously at the Star's School. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Races</strong></span>: Only Galadhrian Humans may be knight adventurers. Exceptions are exceedingly rare but a few dwarves and elves (and maybe even others) residing in Galadhur have been known to follow this path. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Other Classes</strong></span>: A knight adventurer can easily see the benefits of associating with other classes. However, they must always remember the code and a knight will not suffer to associate with one who flaunts their morals and philosophy. Knights adventurer tend to be wise, respected, and trustworthy, so they are often team leaders.

</div>
</div>
<p>All of the following are class features of the knight adventurer. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong></span>: Knights adventurer are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium and light), and with shields. Note that armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Pick Pocket and Tumble. Also, Swim checks suffer a -1 penalty for every 5 pounds of armor and equipment carried. </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Heal</em></span></strong></span>: Each day knights adventurer can heal a total number of hit points equal to their Wisdom bonus (if any) times their level. The knight adventurer can either cure themselves or others, and they can divide their curing among as many recipients as they wish, and they need not use all the points at once. <span class="emphasis"><em> Heal</em></span> is taught to knight adventurers as a spell-like ability which requires the use of a spell gem and the knight adventurer must touch the recipient. It is a full-round action. </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Dauntless</strong></span>: Starting at 2nd level, knights adventurer are immune to the effects of fear, whether normal or magical. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Overbear</strong></span>: Starting at 2nd level, knights adventurer can attempt to overbear their opponents. Overbearing is treated as a bull rush (see PH) except that the knight adventurer may attack while overbearing (either single attack or full-round attack). In addition, the knight is not subject to attacks of opportunity while overbearing. If the overbear fails, instead of being pushed back 5 feet, the knight provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Emboldening Courage</strong></span>: Starting at 3rd level, a knight adventurer's courage is so strong that it emboldens their allies as well. Whenever an ally is within 3 m of the knight adventurer, they gain a +4 moral bonus to their saving throws against fear. 
        </p>

They can use this ability more often as she advances in levels (twice per week at 6th level, three times per week at 9th level, and so forth). <span class="emphasis"><em> Remove disease</em></span> is a spell-like ability for knights adventurer that requires the use of a spell gem and the knight adventurer must touch the recipient. It is a full-round action. </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Mount Empathy</em></span></strong></span>: Knights adventurer are trained to create empathic links with their mounts using magic. See the Knight Adventurer's Mount sidebar for details. The mount must be a heavy warhorse or a heavy treehopper. Mount Empathy is a spell-like ability for knights adventurer that requires the use of a spell gem. 
        </p>
<p>In the case that the knight adventurer's mount dies, they can create an empathic link with a new mount. The knight must wait a month before attempting a new link. Creating the new link takes a month of constant contact between the knight and the new mount. Once linked with, the mount gains all the accumulated benefits due at the knight's level. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Spells</strong></span>: Beginning at 4th level, the knight adventurer gains the ability to cast certain arcane spells in addition to their spell-like abilities listed above. These spells are listed on the knight adventurer spell table. The knight needs to have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level to cast a spell. Knights adventurer gain bonus spells based on their Wisdom score. Saving throws against their spells are DV 10 + spell level + Wisdom modifier. 
        </p>
<p>The knight adventurer has no spell level until 4th level. Then, their caster level is one-half their class level. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong></span>: Upon reaching 4th level, the knight adventurer is able to take Weapon Specialization and related feats as though she were a fighter. (See the description for fighter in the PH.) 
        </p>

Knights adventurer who are found to break the code will be investigated by the Star Original and if they are found guilty they will have their membership revoked and their spell gems confiscated. Here is an outline of the Code: 
        </p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>Be honest, forthright, respect the property of others. Do not lie, cheat, steal or use poison. 
          </li>
<li>Act with honour and morality. 
          </li>
<li>In your deeds, serve and do not contravene the just and ethical authorities and laws. 
          </li>
<li>When able, quell public disorder, and stop crimes. 
          </li>
<li>Protect the lives and the property of those people you meet. 
          </li>
<li>Assist the needy whenever you meet them. 
          </li>
<li>When you profit by your adventures, return the profits to the Star, or donate them to just causes or charities. 
          </li>
<li>Be loyal and good to friends, allies, and just causes. 
          </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Associates</strong></span>: Knights adventurer seek allies who are good people. They value people with diverse talents who can assist them on their adventures. As long as the overall actions of their allies are good, knights adventurer are not overly concerned with their individual behaviour, unless it is obviously evil. Every individual is entitled to their individual code of ethics, as long as it is not evil. Knights adventurer do not adventure with characters who commit evil deeds, such as cold blooded murder, constant theft, flagrant violations of the code, etc.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Knights adventurer are not strictly speaking neutral good, since they believe in the supremacy of justice and ethics. However, if they ever grossly violate the code, fail to act ethically, justly and morally, or cease to be neutral good in a general sense (i.e. begin following another alignment), they are investigated by the Star as above, and they lose their membership and spell gems. In addition, they lose all of their special abilities except Overbear, if that has been gained. 
        </p>
<p>Knights adventurer who go astray may attempt to atone, this is a non-magical process governed by the Star. 
        </p>
<p>Knights adventurer are permitted by be multiclass characters but they face restrictions in this regard. Once the character begins gaining levels as a knight adventurer, she must stick to the class without taking levels in other new or existing classes. If they take a level in another class, they are no longer able to take knight adventurer levels after that. However, they retain their knight adventurer abilities. The heart of a knight adventurer must be dedicated and true.

<p><span class="bold"><strong>Mount Ability Descriptions</strong></span>: Knights adventurer bestow special abilities upon their mounts depending on the level of the knight as shown in the table above. The abilities are cumulative. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Empathic Link</em></span>: The knight adventurer may communicate empathically with the horse. The maximum range for this ability is one kilometer. They can exchange simple emotional impressions and very basic commands. Impressions include happy, hungry, scared, and commands may include come here, run away, fall back. In addition, while mounted, the knight may guide their mount empathically. They do not need to use their knees or make a Ride check in combat (see Ride Skill, in the PH) 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Alertness</em></span>: Through the empathic link, the knight gains the benefit of the mount's sharper senses. While in physical contact with the mount, the knight gains the benefits of the Alertness feat. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Share Spells</em></span>: Through the empathic link, at the knight's option, they can include the mount in the effect of any spell they cast on themselves. The knight must have physical contact with the mount when they cast the spell, and if the contact is broken during the duration of the spell, the spell ceases to affect the mount and will not affect it again for the duration of that spell. The knight can also affect the mount with a spell with a target of "You" (as a touch range spell) instead of themselves. Sharing spells works even if the spell doesn't normally affect creatures of the mount's type (animal). 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Spell resistance</em></span>: The mount's spell resistance equals the knight adventurer's level +5.

<p><span class="bold"><strong>Familiar Ability Descriptions</strong></span>: Sorcerers bestow special abilities on their familiars depending on the level of the master as shown in the table above. The abilities are cumulative. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Alertness</em></span>: The presence of the familiar sharpens its master's senses. While the familiar is in physical contact, the master gains Alertness. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Improved Evasion</em></span>: If the familiar is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw, and half damage even if the saving throw fails. Improved evasion is an extraordinary ability. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Empathic Link</em></span>: The master may communicate empathically with the familiar. The maximum range for this ability is one kilometer. They can exchange simple emotional impressions and very basic commands. Impressions include happy, hungry, scared, and commands may include come here, run away, look around. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Touch</em></span>: Once the master reaches 3rd level, the familiar can deliver touch spells for the master. When the master casts a touch spell, they can designate their familiar as the "toucher". The master and the familiar have to be in contact at the time of casting. The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As normal, if the master casts another spell, the touch spell dissipates. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Speak with master</em></span>: The familiar and master can communicate telepathically when they are in physical contact. The familiar's ability to communicate and understand is limited by its low intelligence. Because they are animals, familiars see the world differently from humans. This is a supernatural ability. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Spell resistance</em></span>: The familiar has spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Bluff attack</em></span>: You can also use Bluff to initiate combat with surprise on your side. Make a normal Bluff check, and if you succeed you get a standard surprise action. The surprise only counts for the character performing the bluff. You may use an unarmed attack, use the Quick Draw feat, or have the weapon in hand. Having the weapon in hand will most likely increase the DC of the Bluff check, since it may pose a risk to the target. Each situation must be handled individually according to the Bluff rules in the PH.
