<h4 class="title"><a id="galad"></a>Humans of Galadhur</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Galadhrians are an ancient race of humans from the area around the Filgreen Coast. They have always been known for their unquenchable desire to explore and their epic adventurousness. To this they add their elven characteristic of practicality and patience. The Galadhrians are a powerhouse of adventurers and traders abroad, but inhumanly stable at home. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Galadhrians typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Their skin is tan, their hair is often curly though straight is known, and facial hair on men ranges from sparse to thick. Galadhrian dress is usually practical and durable, though any number of styles may be seen. Galadhrian humans usually mature at age 20, and often live in excess of 150 years. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> These world travelers mix readily with any race. They are generally very polite, but sometimes this formality is mistaken for coolness. Galadhrians are found in every civilized corner of the world, but it is rare for them to settle down permanently outside of the Alimides. They often serve as merchants, traders, magistrates, and diplomats. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Galadhrians are most frequently good in alignment, and tend towards law or neutrality. Even the heroic adventurers of old were respectful of their nation's institutions. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Galadhrian Lands:</strong></span> Galadhur is a tropical country with rich soil for agriculture. Most of the nation is covered by rural farms and villages. The people tend to be peaceful and prosperous due to the regularity of the seasons. Around the Green Bay and along the coast, fishing is common. Trade is also conducted with the dwarves in the North, who virtually depend on the Galadhrians, and with the rest of the world through Freeport. 
    </p>
<p>Foreigners are common in the major cities of Galadhur, but rare in the countryside. Dwarves are often seen in the north, and traveling along roads to Freeport. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Galadhrians speak Galadhrian, which is also used in trading centers throughout the Alimides. Galadhrian has a written form that has existed for thousands of years, and is loosely based on the elven script. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Thurden.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Female Names:</strong></span> Buffin, Fraua.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Adventuring is Galadhur's national heritage. Galadhrians consider it a prestigious occupation. Adventuring is moderated by the Adventurer's Guild, a powerful extra-national institution based in Freeport. Galadhrians adventure for glory above all, as well as wealth and power.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This description applies to Trians as well as the humans from Thiria and Eila (subject nations of the Trian empire). 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description</strong></span>: Trians typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Their skin is olive in colour, and their hair is curly and ranges through blonde, brown and black. Facial hair on men can be sparse or thick. Trians have short life spans, achieving adulthood at about age 15 and rarely living even a single century. 
    </p>
<p>Trians have unusual eye coloring. The colour of the pupil changes with their emotional state (like a mood ring). The pupil colours are given in the figure below. In addition, the sclera of the eye (usually called the "white") is black offsetting the colour.

</div>
<br class="figure-break" />
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations</strong></span>: Trians are an overbearing people who desire control and power. They do not possess the sense of goodness that is common in Edion and to a lesser extent in the rest of the Alimides. Tria is an empire that rules over many neighbouring nations including Thiria and Eila. The Trian empire is intended for primarily for the benefit of Trians, and thus it is not popular in some quarters of the world. Individual Trian imperial agents are treated with suspicion in the Alimides. Other Trians are usually assessed on their individual merits, but the lingering suspicion remains. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion</strong></span>: Trians worship a pantheon of gods. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language</strong></span>: Trians speak Trian, the language spoken throughout the Trian empire. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Quartius, Rojek.

<h4 class="title"><a id="elves_of_elara"></a>Elves of Elara</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Elara elves don't change very much over time. An Elaran elf might do the same job, make the same decisions, for fifty or a hundred years. Then, all of a sudden, a sudden fever will strike and he will change occupations, renounce his former style of thinking, or travel to a new land. This phenomenon can strike at any moment, without any warning, but it typically only happens once or twice in an elf's life, it ever. Otherwise, elves are inhumanly patient, willing to spend decades growing a specific plant to a specific shape, or to while away weeks discussing a certain point of philosophy. 
    </p>
<p>There is another form of the fever, called the rage, which has been known to infect entire populations of elves. The rage spreads a single individual's ideology to large groups, like an air-born infection. This occurs only rarely, perhaps once a century at most, but the results are generally famous (or infamous). 
    </p>
<p>Elves are curious and literate. They hold beauty and the arts dear. They are eager to learn, but like an armchair historian often prefer to let someone else to the work. Still, the other races prize their knowledge of theory and philosophy. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Elaran elves shorter than humans, ranging from 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet in height and weighing from 90 to 150 pounds. While graceful in appearance, they have longer arms and shorter legs than humans, a feature well suited to their tree-based lifestyle. Still, their limbs are lithe and slim. Elaran elves generally have tan skin, dark hair and deep green eyes. They have no facial or body hair. They prefer simple, comfortable clothes, and they enjoy simple yet elegant jewelry. An Elaran elf matures when he reaches the age of about 100, and they typically live to an age of about 550 years. 
    </p>
<p>Elaran elves sleep normally but eat less than half what a humans eats. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> Elaran humans have great respect for the Galadhrian humans with their adventurousness and stability. They tolerate Roarians, valuing their martial skill. Trians are abhorrent to Elaran elves, but no elf would ever treat any individual Trian with less than neutrality. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Elves love stability, variety and beauty. They tend towards neutrality when trying to make these sometimes conflicting views work together. Elves are virtually always good, desiring a world in which everyone is happy. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Elaran Elven Lands:</strong></span> Elaran elves tend to live in dense jungle, where they make their homes high in the mid-levels and the canopy of the trees. They use their mastery of plants and their endless patience to shape their homes, towns, and roads from the very flora that surrounds them. The lush jungle amply provides game for hunting as well as fruit, fungi and other food plants unknown outside their lands. Thus most elves have ample time to work crafts and arts which they trade with the outside world for metals and other raw materials. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span> Elaran elves mostly are atheist. Bishism is a monastic order based on the principles first expounded by the mythical monk Bish. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Elves speak a fluid language of subtle intonations and intricate grammar. While elven literature is rich and varied, it is the language's songs and poems that are most famous. While Elaran is a poetic language, Elarans usually use Galadhrian for practical texts and with foreigners. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Athravian, Delatar, Elashar, Eochar, Farmian, Helman, Lellendrile, Nämian, Renian, Sorfar, Teridel.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Female Names:</strong></span> Anyana, Bindë, Emenë, Filmarë, Lyana, Rillenë, Themerya, Wylana.
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Elves take up adventuring because of wanderlust, often following a bout of the "fever." Some elves adventure on a voyage of discovery, seeing themselves as brave explorers. Often elves also enjoy impressing the other races with their wisdom and martial skill.

<h4 class="title"><a id="roarians"></a>Roarians</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Roarians are fierce predators and patient enemies. It is therefore fortunate for the other intelligent races that they also tend to be somewhat lazy. Roarians enjoy the hunt but also enjoy sitting and observing. They tend to be more aware of immediate rewards than long-term concerns. A certain fatalism may be part of the reason why Roarians usually claim to be unconcerned with the future. However, many Roarians seem to believe that their lives is in fact a struggle against a dark fate, an attitude that may reflect their animalistic origins. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Roarians resemble tigers that stand on two feet. While they are humanoid, they have claws, sharp teeth, and are thoroughly carnivorous. Their skin is covered in orange fur, striped with black, and as a result most Roarians wear clothing only on their lower body. They are tall, ranging from 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet tall on average, and well muscled. Their eyes are yellow and cat-like and their faces are generally whiskered. Roarians mature a little faster than humans, at age 12, and usually live no more than 70 years. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> Roarians get along well with elves, who share their love of the jungle. However unlike elves they are heavily involved in the present and don't appreciate the elven esteem for tradition. Their relations with the Galadhrian humans is more strained, since Roarians consider personal ties more important than official ones. The Roarian attitude towards Trians is strained, but the empire has so far proven uninterested or unable to dominate the Roarian jungles. Roarians treat them with initial suspicion but warm rapidly to Trians who are not zealous for the empire. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Roarians are usually chaotic, and they are often neutral. Traveling or adventuring Roarians tend towards good, however, since they quickly shake off their jungle kill-or-be-killed attitude. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Roarian Lands:</strong></span> Roarians tend to live deep in the jungle. There they form clans and villages in loose relationships. Roaria is a wild and mostly untamed wilderness, thick with the species upon which the tiger-people prey. 
    </p>
<p>Roarians in human lands are often mercenaries, hunters, bounty hunters, rogues and smugglers. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span> Roaria has two dominant religions. Sédan is the dominant religion in the lowlands of Roaria, while mountain Roarians follow a mystical religion known as Danbulé. The lowland religion Sédan consists of a pantheon of gods representing natural features such as the sea, the forest, the sky, and so on. The most important deities are Rambula, goddess of the jungle predators and Vumjaa of the Rain. Danbulé is a polytheistic religion with an uncounted number of deities. Virtually each practitioner is known to believe in a unique deity. The gods of Danbulé however are merely manifestations of the spiritual power that surrounds all things. Danbulés practice animal sacrifice and enter trances influenced by powerful herbal mixtures where they believe they can speak to the gods and channel their powers. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Roarians speak Roarian, which uses the elven script in the rare cases where it is written. Travelers usually learn Trian or Galadhrian. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Malaccar Tigranos. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Many Roarians believe their race is underestimated by the outside world. Many Roarians adventure to prove that their race is just as powerful as the others are. Many Roarian adventurers seek profit, or merely to pit their skills against the outside world and then return in triumph to their homeland.
