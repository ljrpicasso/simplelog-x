<h4 class="title"><a id="knight"></a>Knight Adventurer</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The knight adventurer is Galadhur's response to the need for armed defenders of the realm. The adventuring knight is loosely speaking a representative of the government. In other words, they have the permission of the King to maintain order, to defend the land, to succor the needy, to punish the transgressor and perpetrator of evil. They are sworn to uphold a code of honour. 
    </p>
<p>The Core Hold of Knights is an institute that attempts to educate and train the adventuring knights. Many indeed of the adventuring knights at large are graduates of the Hold. But, not all. The only qualification necessary to be an adventuring knight is to add one's name to the list in the Hold. That, and to recite the code, which is short and simple. However all know that knights who go errant are hunted down relentlessly and rendered against the Core. So, most every knight adventurer is a good knight, and honest and proud of their position. 
    </p>
<p>Those knights adventurer who are graduates of the Star may wear the symbol of the shimmering star on their arms and this is the most important badge of respect. But in some cases knights gain their own respect and that of the people as well without attending the Hold. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventures</strong></span>: Knights adventurer are free to go where they will. Sometimes they form bands and other times they adventure alone. Other times they find that it helps to join with groups with other talents. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Characteristic</strong></span>: Knights adventurer are known both for exploring and for steadfast honour and courage. It is this combination that makes them unique. They are a firm post of steadiness, and at the same time they are always seeking to go outwards to new things. Often they are philosophical, searching for the ultimate in moral truths, to expand their view of the ideal life, to improve their self. In any case they also seek to influence those they meet, at least through their own example of justice and honour. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment</strong></span>: Knights adventurer must be of neutral good (variant) alignment. Knights adventurer follow a code of conduct that stresses ethics and moral conduct. They would have the world be just, peaceful and prosperous, and look to spread this ideology to those whom they meet. One of the most important ways for them to do this is to live their own lives in such a manner. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion</strong></span>: The Core of Knights is non-secular. Their creed is humanistic and based on moral and codes that are drawn from real life, not from an abstract deity. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Background</strong></span>: Adventurers are glorified in Edion. Many youngsters dream of growing up to be a world explorer. Those who add a sense of morality to that dream tend to be attracted to the Star of Knights. If they are smart and strong enough, they may be taken on by the star as students and raised in the ways of the knight adventurer. 
    </p>
<p>While they believe that the strength of their steel should suffice in smiting the amoral and evil, they turn to magic to succor the needy. The true knight adventurer is a master of this kind of magic, and its mastery takes long and hard years of study combined with inherent wisdom. This study starts rigorously at the Star's School. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Races</strong></span>: Only Galadhrian Humans may be knight adventurers. Exceptions are exceedingly rare but a few dwarves and elves (and maybe even others) residing in Galadhur have been known to follow this path. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Other Classes</strong></span>: A knight adventurer can easily see the benefits of associating with other classes. However, they must always remember the code and a knight will not suffer to associate with one who flaunts their morals and philosophy. Knights adventurer tend to be wise, respected, and trustworthy, so they are often team leaders.

</div>
</div>
<p>All of the following are class features of the knight adventurer. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong></span>: Knights adventurer are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium and light), and with shields.

<p><span class="bold"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Heal</em></span></strong></span>: Each day knights adventurer can heal a total number of hit points equal to their Wisdom bonus (if any) times their level. The knight adventurer can either cure themselves or others, and they can divide their curing among as many recipients as they wish, and they need not use all the points at once. <span class="emphasis"><em> Heal</em></span> is taught to knight adventurers as a spell-like ability which requires the use of a spell gem and the knight adventurer must touch the recipient. It is a full-round action. </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Dauntless</strong></span>: Starting at 2nd level, knights adventurer are immune to the effects of fear, whether normal or magical. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Overbear</strong></span>: Starting at 2nd level, knights adventurer can attempt to overbear their opponents. Overbearing is treated as a bull rush (see PH) except that the knight adventurer may attack while overbearing (either single attack or full-round attack). In addition, the knight is not subject to attacks of opportunity while overbearing. If the overbear fails, instead of being pushed back 5 feet, the knight provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Emboldening Courage</strong></span>: Starting at 3rd level, a knight adventurer's courage is so strong that it emboldens their allies as well. Whenever an ally is within 3 m of the knight adventurer, they gain a +4 moral bonus to their saving throws against fear. 
        </p>

<p><span class="bold"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Mount Empathy</em></span></strong></span>: Knights adventurer are trained to create empathic links with their mounts using magic. See the Knight Adventurer's Mount sidebar for details. The mount must be a heavy warhorse or a heavy treehopper. Mount Empathy is a spell-like ability for knights adventurer that requires the use of a spell gem. 
        </p>
<p>In the case that the knight adventurer's mount dies, they can create an empathic link with a new mount. The knight must wait a month before attempting a new link. Creating the new link takes a month of constant contact between the knight and the new mount. Once linked with, the mount gains all the accumulated benefits due at the knight's level. 
        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Spells</strong></span>: Beginning at 4th level, the knight adventurer gains the ability to cast certain arcane spells in addition to their spell-like abilities listed above. These spells are listed on the knight adventurer spell table. The knight needs to have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level to cast a spell. Knights adventurer gain bonus spells based on their Wisdom score. Saving throws against their spells are DV 10 + spell level + Wisdom modifier. 
        </p>

        </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong></span>: Upon reaching 4th level, the knight adventurer is able to take Weapon Specialization and related feats as though she were a fighter. (See the description for fighter in the PH.) 
        </p>

        </p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>Be honest, forthright, respect the property of others. Do not lie, cheat, steal or use poison. 
          </li>
<li>Act with honour and morality. 
          </li>
<li>In your deeds, serve and do not contravene the just and ethical authorities and laws. 
          </li>
<li>When able, quell public disorder, and stop crimes. 
          </li>
<li>Protect the lives and the property of those people you meet. 
          </li>
<li>Assist the needy whenever you meet them. 
          </li>
<li>When you profit by your adventures, return the profits to the Star, or donate them to just causes or charities. 
          </li>

          </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Associates</strong></span>: Knights adventurer seek allies who are good people. They value people with diverse talents who can assist them on their adventures. As long as the overall actions of their allies are good, knights adventurer are not overly concerned with their individual behaviour, unless it is obviously evil. Every individual is entitled to their individual code of ethics, as long as it is not evil. Knights adventurer do not adventure with characters who commit evil deeds, such as cold blooded murder, constant theft, flagrant violations of the code, etc.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Knights adventurer are not strictly speaking neutral good, since they believe in the supremacy of justice and ethics. However, if they ever grossly violate the code, fail to act ethically, justly and morally, or cease to be neutral good in a general sense (i.e. begin following another alignment), they are investigated by the Star as above, and they lose their membership and spell gems. In addition, they lose all of their special abilities except Overbear, if that has been gained. 
        </p>
<p>Knights adventurer who go astray may attempt to atone, this is a non-magical process governed by the Star. 
        </p>
<p>Knights adventurer are permitted by be multiclass characters but they face restrictions in this regard. Once the character begins gaining levels as a knight adventurer, she must stick to the class without taking levels in other new or existing classes. If they take a level in another class, they are no longer able to take knight adventurer levels after that. However, they retain their knight adventurer abilities. The heart of a knight adventurer must be dedicated and true.

<p><span class="bold"><strong>Mount Ability Descriptions</strong></span>: Knights adventurer bestow special abilities upon their mounts depending on the level of the knight as shown in the table above. The abilities are cumulative. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Empathic Link</em></span>: The knight adventurer may communicate empathically with the horse. The maximum range for this ability is one kilometer. They can exchange simple emotional impressions and very basic commands. Impressions include happy, hungry, scared, and commands may include come here, run away, fall back. In addition, while mounted, the knight may guide their mount empathically. They do not need to use their knees or make a Ride check in combat (see Ride Skill, in the PH) 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Alertness</em></span>: Through the empathic link, the knight gains the benefit of the mount's sharper senses. While in physical contact with the mount, the knight gains the benefits of the Alertness feat. 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Share Spells</em></span>: Through the empathic link, at the knight's option, they can include the mount in the effect of any spell they cast on themselves. The knight must have physical contact with the mount when they cast the spell, and if the contact is broken during the duration of the spell, the spell ceases to affect the mount and will not affect it again for the duration of that spell. The knight can also affect the mount with a spell with a target of "You" (as a touch range spell) instead of themselves. Sharing spells works even if the spell doesn't normally affect creatures of the mount's type (animal). 
      </p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Spell resistance</em></span>: The mount's spell resistance equals the knight adventurer's level +5.
