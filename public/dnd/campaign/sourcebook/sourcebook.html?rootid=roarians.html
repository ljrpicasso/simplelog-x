<h4 class="title"><a id="roarians"></a>Roarians</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Personality:</strong></span> Roarians are fierce predators and patient enemies. It is therefore fortunate for the other intelligent races that they also tend to be somewhat lazy. Roarians enjoy the hunt but also enjoy sitting and observing. They tend to be more aware of immediate rewards than long-term concerns. A certain fatalism may be part of the reason why Roarians usually claim to be unconcerned with the future. However, many Roarians seem to believe that their lives is in fact a struggle against a dark fate, an attitude that may reflect their animalistic origins. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Physical Description:</strong></span> Roarians resemble tigers that stand on two feet. While they are humanoid, they have claws, sharp teeth, and are thoroughly carnivorous. Their skin is covered in orange fur, striped with black, and as a result most Roarians wear clothing only on their lower body. They are tall, ranging from 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet tall on average, and well muscled. Their eyes are yellow and cat-like and their faces are generally whiskered. Roarians mature a little faster than humans, at age 12, and usually live no more than 70 years. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Relations:</strong></span> Roarians get along well with elves, who share their love of the jungle. However unlike elves they are heavily involved in the present and don't appreciate the elven esteem for tradition. Their relations with the Galadhrian humans is more strained, since Roarians consider personal ties more important than official ones. The Roarian attitude towards Trians is strained, but the empire has so far proven uninterested or unable to dominate the Roarian jungles. Roarians treat them with initial suspicion but warm rapidly to Trians who are not zealous for the empire. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span> Roarians are usually chaotic, and they are often neutral. Traveling or adventuring Roarians tend towards good, however, since they quickly shake off their jungle kill-or-be-killed attitude. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Roarian Lands:</strong></span> Roarians tend to live deep in the jungle. There they form clans and villages in loose relationships. Roaria is a wild and mostly untamed wilderness, thick with the species upon which the tiger-people prey. 
    </p>
<p>Roarians in human lands are often mercenaries, hunters, bounty hunters, rogues and smugglers. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Religion:</strong></span> Roaria has two dominant religions. Sédan is the dominant religion in the lowlands of Roaria, while mountain Roarians follow a mystical religion known as Danbulé. The lowland religion Sédan consists of a pantheon of gods representing natural features such as the sea, the forest, the sky, and so on. The most important deities are Rambula, goddess of the jungle predators and Vumjaa of the Rain. Danbulé is a polytheistic religion with an uncounted number of deities. Virtually each practitioner is known to believe in a unique deity. The gods of Danbulé however are merely manifestations of the spiritual power that surrounds all things. Danbulés practice animal sacrifice and enter trances influenced by powerful herbal mixtures where they believe they can speak to the gods and channel their powers. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Language:</strong></span> Roarians speak Roarian, which uses the elven script in the rare cases where it is written. Travelers usually learn Trian or Galadhrian. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Names:</strong></span>
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Male Names:</strong></span> Malaccar Tigranos. 
    </p>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Adventurers:</strong></span> Many Roarians believe their race is underestimated by the outside world. Many Roarians adventure to prove that their race is just as powerful as the others are. Many Roarian adventurers seek profit, or merely to pit their skills against the outside world and then return in triumph to their homeland.

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">

        </li>

        </li>
<li>Low-Light Vision: Roarians can see twice as far as a human in starlight moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.  
        </li>
