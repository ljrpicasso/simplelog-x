</div>
</div>
<p>The Alimides is a vast sea region that includes the continent of Edion and a 
    large archipelago -- a group of islands -- that lies to the south of the continent. 
    The great landmass of Edion lies at the top of the archipelago. But the islands that
    make up the rest of the Alimides have almost an equal area of land, divided up among
    hundred of islands both small and large.

<h4 class="title"><a id="tria"></a>The Trian Empire</h4>
</div>

<p>The Trian Empire occupies an massive continent that lies to the north and east of
    Edion. Most of the geography of that continent is unknown.

<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2376361"></a>Overview</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Edion is a roughly oval continent, stretching 4000 km across at the widest point, 
    east to west. There is a great deal of difference between the nothern half of the 
    continent and the south. In the north there is a wasteland of desert scrub that is largely
    uninhabitable. The northern coasts are difficult and there are few ports. A mountain range,
    the Doromores, cuts across the continent dividing north from south. South of the range, the
    environment is quite the opposite, a pleasant jungle with plenty of rainfall and 
    habitation.
    </p>
<p>Because the north of the continent is an uninhabited wasteland, we will speak of 
    the "east" and the "west" of Edion as actually the south-east and south-west of the
    continent. The east and west are divided (below the Doromore range) by another range of 
    mountains which builds up from foothills at the southernmost tip of the continent
    towards a great mass of peaks in the center. This is the Tikmurn range.
    </p>
<p>To the east of the Tikmurn range lies mainly jungle in which the elven nation
    of Elara makes its home. To the west of the range first lies the Edion Forest, the 
    deepest and most mysterious jungle of Edion. Beyond that is the open space of the 
    Filgreen coast which lies around the edges of the massive Bay of Bromar, which
    reaches inward almost to the Doromore mountains. Beyond the bay is the other side of
    the Filgreen coast and another range of mountains, the Atlars, which clutters up the entire
    western end of the continent.
    </p>
<p>Of these western lands, the Edion Forest is home to a cult of elven druids who
    keep out all intruders. The Filgreen coast and the Bay of Bromar is the domain of the
    humans of Galadhur. The Atlar moutains north and west of the bay, at the western end of the 
    continent and the Doromore range, are occupied by dwarves. Elara and Galadhur are important
    enough in their own right to be detailed in a separate section.

<h4 class="title"><a id="id2376417"></a>The Filgreen Coast (area)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Filgreen Coast is a wide and fertile crescent of land that surrounds the Bay of Bromar.
    It is on this coast that most of the territory of Galadhur lies.
    </p>
<p>In contrast to the rest of southern Edion, the Filgreen Coast is mostly open and flat. 
    Most of the area is taken by agriculture, with fields of wheat, rice, beans, etc., growing
    abundentdly after the rains. A substantial minority of the land is covered in forest retained
    for hunting.
    </p>

<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="id2376441"></a>Galadhur (nation)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Galadhur a major nation of Edion that occupies most of the region known as the Filgreen
Coast. Despite the easy living at home, Galadhrians have turned their interests abroad, to
trading and exploration. Education is free, and the country maintains a powerful navy easily
the match of any other in the Alimides.
</p>
<p>Part of the mystique of Galadhur is its early days of exploration. It is Galadhrians 
who first explored the myriad seaways of the Alimides, forging the network of trade that links
the whole region. Perhaps because of living on the Bay of Bromar, Galadhrians feel the pull
of the ocean to carry them abroad. Most foreign trade in the Alimides runs on Galadhrian
ships. Galadhrians carry packet mail from island to island. Galadhrians protect the seaways
from occasional pirates and sea monsters.
</p>
<p>The home port of Galadhur and its capital is the city of Freeport, a lively mix of
natives and foreigners there to trade and learn. There is a strong independent streak in
Galadhrians, and the city of Freeport in many ways considers itself independent of the 
whims of the nation. Still, overlooking the city from a tall promontory is the famous 
castle of Galadhursild, the name-sake of the nation and the royal seat.

<h4 class="title"><a id="id2376659"></a>The Edion Forest (area)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sandwiched between the Filgreen Coast and the central Tikmurn mountains lies a vast, dense jungle called the Edion Forest. Little is known about the Forest except that it is the domain of a collection of elvish druids. These powerful magicians practice their arts with an aim to keep the forest clear from human interference. Thus, few enter the forest and even fewer leave it. It is said that the elves can see through the eyes of woodland animals and that no one enters the woods without their knowledge. It is also rumoured that at the heart of the forest lies a major druidic city where the druids live in Shilara trees, the source, apparently, of their power.
    </p>

<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="elara"></a>Elara (nation)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Elara is elven homeland. Elves have dwelled here since before time began ... at least
    before recorded history began. And since elves have the longest records of any culture on
    Edion, that's a long time.
    </p>
<p>
    The elves live in the heights of massive Shilara trees, a hundred meters above the jungle
    floor. Although dangerous predators lurk on the surface, up in the understory of the forest
    that covers the country, it's relatively safe. Still, most Elarans go about their daily
    life with a knife at their belt. They also carry featherfall gems that give them one free
    trip down to the forest floor should they fall.
    </p>
<p>
    Elaran culture is civilized but the elves still live in close proximity with nature. They
    have mastered the art of magical gardening, and their gardeners can shape plants over long
    periods of time into houses, buildings, and even vine-like paths between the trees. Most
    Elarans live and work in domiciles that are actually living plants, slowly nurtured into 
    their present shapes over dozens of years.
    </p>
<p>
    The lengthy elven lifespan dictates a calm pace of life in Elara. Most of the elves life
    to be five hundred years or more. Thus elves will not blink an eye at an endeavour of 
    gardening of otherwise that takes decades to accomplish. The country is covered with ancient
    but still functioning works of magical architecture that have been built up over many 
    millenia.
    </p>
<p>
    Since the jungle is so abundant with wildlife and fruit and vegetables, the elves need spend
    little of their time of the basics of life. This leaves most elves ample time to pursue their
    personal interests, whether this is in crafts, intellectual, or spiritual matters. Elarans
    are a highly educated and advanced people. Their cities are jewels of civilization. Most
    elves have spent at least a decade in school, and are free to pursue artistic or arcane arts.
    </p>
<p>
    Elara is made up of five major provinces. Each has a different character and flavour. The
    most mysterious is Ceylar, a hidden realm in the northwest of the country. The others admit
    foreigners with varying levels of welcome.
    </p>
<p>
    Of the three major cities, Arcos is by far the most international. It is the Elaran city of 
    trade and here large populations of humans, halflings, roarians, and even Trians can be found
    living beside the elves. Next in welcoming outsiders is Sheliar, the capital city of Elara.
    Although it is near the coast, it is dominated by elves. Miriar is Elara's internal city,
    far up the Epian river and mostly closed to outsiders.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="ceylar"></a>Ceylar (province)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Easily the most xenophobic and secretive elves of Elara, Ceylarans are also the most
distinctive due to their dark, almost black, skin. Still, they are rarely seen by other elves, 
as they sequester themselves in the mysterious province of Ceylar. By their own design, 
Ceylar has wrapped itself with a protective mantle of magical beasts, through which none may pass.
Their permission is rarely -- if ever -- given.
</p>
<p>Ceylar occupies a central position in the continent, abutting both the Doromore and
Tikmurn ranges in the north-western corner of Elara. The land is high, and much of it is
a cloud forest, misty almost all the time. There is a magical barrier that surrounds the
territory, a zone in which a variety of dangerous monsters are held in order to prevent
intruders from passing into the provice proper. These monsters are referred to as the 
"watchers". That they are magical beasts is indicated by reports of blue, glowing eyes
from a few brave or foolhearty intruders who have survived to tell the tale.
</p>
<p>As for what lies within the province, it is difficult to say. Many speculate that
it is a vast trove of historical knowledge, as the Ceylaran life-span is rumored to be
upwards of 2000 years. Bolstering this argument is the indisputable fact that Ceylaran
elves periodically leave their homeland to involve themselves as advisors in the 
politics and international dealings of Elara. They usually provide indispensible perspective
and advice.

<h4 class="title"><a id="arcos"></a>Arcos (city)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Arcos is the most international city in Elara. It is a bustling port, full of foreigners meeting for trade, politics, or simply passing through. Some consider it the most important port in the Alimides, since it is more centrally located than Freeport.

<h5 class="title"><a id="id2376910"></a>Location</h5>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Arcos is situated on the bank of the river Amaderian about 10 km from the coast. The city slopes gently up from the river bank. It sits at the end of a strip of open land that hugs the shoreline of the ocean for some distance to the east. Open land also continues north up the river for another 10 km before giving way to the jungle. 
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h5 class="title"><a id="id2376928"></a>Landmarks</h5>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The city proper is encircled by a town wall that dates from the Alimidean war many years ago. Inside the wall the major landmarks include the provincial palace, the opera house, the international market, and the Tree. 
      </p>
<p>Arcos is an ancient and beautiful city. Many of the structure are thousands of years old. The Arcosian style is sleek. The quality of materials is very important to the city's architects and artists. 
      </p>
<p>The resident community of elves tend to live in the elven quarter which is separately walled although access is freely given to anyone and there are many gates. The quarter is distinguished by a veritable garden of flora hanging from roofs, growing out of pots, and clinging to walls. Many of the buildings here are very tall, and made from living rock or live trees. 
      </p>
<p>The international quarter is the home to many of the foreigners living in the city. The international market lies on the edge of this quarter, near the center of town, and during the daylight is always busy with people. Parts of the international quarter, like the Galadhrian district, are neat and ordered, while others, like the Trian district, are maze-like hives that upright citizens avoid at night. Most of the international quarter is walled and at night the gates are staffed by guards. 
      </p>
<p>The royal quarter surrounds the provincial palace and is home to a variety of people of various races, and many institutes, schools, and temples. 
      </p>
<p>The docklands along the river is full of warehouses, merchants, and sailors from all over the world. It is well patrolled by the city guard. 
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h5 class="title"><a id="id2382550"></a>The Tree</h5>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Tree is a massive tree-shaped structure of living rock. Hundreds of dwellings are perched on the branches or formed out of the rock. It is covered in live plants so that it looks from a distance like a huge living tree. The Tree houses a hodgepodge community of elves and foreigners who are bohemians, nonconformists, or lead slightly shady lifestyles. The Arcos guard doesn't enter the Tree, but the inhabitants have a live and let live code that doesn't suffer violence. 
      </p>
<p>Traveling about the Tree is a matter best left in the hands of a guide. Its ways and byways are confusing and three-dimensional. Most inhabitants carry feather-fall gems for safety. 
      </p>
<p>At the base of the Tree is a preserve that is left in a state of native jungle. Except for the path that leads to the stairs and skywalk up to the branches, the area that falls in the shadow of the tree is dangerous at night due to predators. 
      </p>
<p>The preserve is surrounded by a high wall and there are only two entrances to the Tree from ground level, one to the stair and the other to the skywalk. The gates are guarded at all times by the Arcos city guard.

<div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="sheliar"></a>Sheliar (city)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sheliar is the capital city of Elara. It is a busy city, with a thriving dock trade that takes care of shipping towards the east with Roaria and the Trian empire. Merchants from Freeport, the Alimides, Roaria, and Tria gather at the dockyards to trade elven crafts, spices and herbs, and rare animals. As the national capital, the city also hosts several of the most majestic buildings in Elara.
    </p>
<p>The Elaran Royal Palace dominates even the spires of the Bishic temples. The palace is walled with white stone that extends around the entire citadel. The walls, spires, indeed the entire palace is made from the same white stone, seemingly from a single rock, as there are no seams or cracks to be found in the entire structure. Spires, carved delicately to resemble natural plants and trees, rise hundreds of metres from the complex, and sprout delicate stone carved branches which shimmer in the daylight with the reflections from thousands of golden leaves. Inside the palace walls, surrounding the citadel is a garden of elaran delights: tropical flowers and fruit-bearing trees.
    </p>
<p>The elves of Sheliar are widely concerned with the affairs of world trade,  governance and conflict. They welcome the presence of humans and other races in their midst, since the traders and visitors bring with them a wealth of news of foreign affairs. Despite their interest in the visitors, however, Sheriarites tend to avoid close relations with other races, since they (rightly by comparison, most of the time) regard them as short-lived, emotional, and violent. However there is a deep-rooted ambivalence to this attitude in the city, and a thriving population of elves who mix, marry, and live freely with non-elves.

<h4 class="title"><a id="miriar"></a>Miriar (city)</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Miriar is the traditional heart of Elara. It is the Elaran city that most closely mirrors the standard elven way of life: peaceful, slow-paced, and creative.
    </p>
<p>The population of Miriar is almost entirely elves. For other races, the interests and endeavours of rural elves proceed at a level of detail that can seem beyond belief. The attention span of an elf can last for days, months, even years, on a single aspect of a project or a single conversation.
    </p>
<p>Miriar is a forest city. Like most Elaran towns and villages, it is found off the ground, up in the branches of the huge trees that make up the Elaran jungle. Most structures here are grown and tended by arcane gardeners, so they are living buildings. They are connected by vine-like pathways and roads and range from just a few dozen metres off the forest floor, to high up in the attic just below the canopy.
    </p>
<p>What business is done in the city centers around fine crafts. Raw materials and finished goods trade hands here and pass in and out of the great craft schools where the lore of making jewelry, arcane gardening, weapon-making, wood-carving, gem-cutting, weaving, etc. are concentrated. Most elves practise crafts for interest rather than profit, but there is still a substantial trade due to the volume of output. In addition, the elves need foreign materials to practise certain attractive hobbies (like gem-cutting).

</div>
</div>
<p>A few thousand kilometers north-east from Edion lies the south-western 
  shore of Tria, ruler-nation of the Trian Empire, a vast domain that spreads 
  east and north across the lands of a much larger continent. Thiria and Ilia 
  are just some of the nations suborned by the Empire. 
  </p>
<p>The empire of Tria is a mighty one, spanning a vast portion of the continent that lies
  to the East of Edion, past the island nations of Roaria and Trilodan. It is also a relatively
  new empire. It has spawned over the last thousand years, absorbing neighbouring countries
  such as Eila with powerful military strength.
