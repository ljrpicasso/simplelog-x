Although not evil, it thirsts after bodily fluids and seems to prefer the blood of intelligent creatures.</p><p>A gibbering mouther is about 3 feet across and 3 to 4 feet high. It weighs about 200 pounds.</p><p>Gibbering mouthers can speak Common, but seldom say anything other than gibberish.</p><h4>Combat</h4><p>A gibbering mouther attacks by shooting out strings of protoplasmic flesh, each ending in one or more eyes and a mouth that bites at the enemy. A mouther can send out a total of six such members in any round.</p>GibberingSu<p><b>Gibbering (Su):</b> As soon as a mouther spots something edible, it begins a constant gibbering as a free action. All creatures (other than mouthers) within a 60-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as though by a <a href="/dnd/srd/spells/srd:confusion" class="spell">confusion</a> spell for 1d2 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same gibbering mouther's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>SpittleEx<p><b>Spittle (Ex):</b> As a free action every round, a gibbering mouther fires a stream of spittle at one opponent within 30 feet. The mouther makes a ranged touch attack; if it hits, it deals 1d4 points of acid damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Eyeless creatures are immune to the blinding effect, but are still subject to the acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>Improved GrabEx<p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a gibbering mouther must hit with a bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>Blood DrainEx<p><b>Blood Drain (Ex):</b> On a successful grapple check after grabbing, that mouth attaches to the opponent. It automatically deals bite damage and drains blood, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round. A mouth can be ripped off (dealing 1 point of damage) with a DC 12 Strength check or severed by a successful sunder attempt (the mouth has 2 hit points).</p><p>A severed mouth continues to bite and drain blood for 1d4 rounds after such an attack. A creature whose Constitution is reduced to 0 is killed.</p>EngulfEx<p><b>Engulf (Ex):</b> A gibbering mouther can try to engulf a Medium or smaller opponent grabbed by three or more mouths.</p><p>The opponent must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or fall and be engulfed. In the next round, the mouther makes twelve bite attacks instead of six (each with a +4 attack bonus). An engulfed creature cannot attack the mouther from within. The previously attached mouths are now free to attack others. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p>Ground ManipulationSu<p><b>Ground Manipulation (Su):</b> At will, as a standard action, a gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth in all adjacent squares to become a morass akin to quicksand. Softening earth, sand, or the like takes 1 round, while stone takes 2 rounds. Anyone other than the mouther in that area must take a move-equivalent action to avoid becoming mired (treat as being pinned).</p>AmorphousEx<p><b>Amorphous (Ex):</b> A gibbering mouther is not subject to critical hits. It cannot be flanked.</p>Skills<p><b>Skills:</b> Thanks to their multiple eyes, gibbering mouthers have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p><p>A gibbering mouther has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><p></p>
